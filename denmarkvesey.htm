ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
There was no doubt about it, Denmark Vesey was a handsome man. He had an arrogance about him that superseded his culture. Women in carriages cast furtive glances when Denmark walked down the street. The one thing about Denmark, that was not apparent on this beautiful day in Charleston, was that yesterday, he was a slave.
Denmark had just purchased his freedom and a new suit, in that order.  This was intoxicating to Denmark. Everything about his life would now be different. As Denmark strutted down King Street with all the Monday businessmen, he assessed his accomplishments. It was unique in the 1800's for a slave to become free. It was especially unique in the South. His life had not been easy. He had been sold at the age of 14 to a slave trader, named Joseph Vesey. He had made many voyages with Vesey to New England to trade tobacco, sugar cane and molasses for rum and guns.  Then the rum and guns were taken to Africa to barter for slaves.  In 1778, Denmark had even helped his master when he took his ship to Haiti. They had rescued the French when the Haitian slaves had revolted.  Yes, Denmark had a right to be proud.
Listening to the many carriages coursing their way down the hot, dusty roads of Charleston, mesmerized Denmark. His eyes focused inwardly to  his memories of the beautiful island hills of ST. John's.  Thinking back to his childhood, Denmark saw the eyes of his young mother, as she was worked on the sugar plantation. She had the rheumy eyes of an old woman. Denmark could not remember a time when she smiled.  Slavery is an aberration of mankind.  But for Denmark, slavery is the only way of life he ever knew. He was born into slavery and until today, never knew freedom. He still hears his mother's last words to him as he was being herded into the back of the wagon. "Submit to the white man and you will survive. Pay homage to the white man and you will live. But keep your spirit. White man cannot break that which he does not have. For a slave who has his spirit, has life."

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

SLAVERY IS AN ABERRATION OF MANKIND. 
SLAVERY IS WRONG. 
WHY IS IT SO HARD TO SAY TO A GROUP OF PEOPLE, WE ARE SORRY FOR THE PAST. 
WHY DO SOME STILL BELIEVE THAT ANOTHER HUMAN BEING, WHOSE HEART BEATS LIKE THEIRS, IS SO DIFFERENT (INFERIOR)?
EVERY ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS.
NO ONE CAN FORCE ANOTHER TO SERVE HIM. 
THERE OUGHT TO BE RESTITUTION TO A RACE WHO HAD STOLEN FROM THEM THEIR FAMILIES, THEIR CULTURE, THEIR HISTORY, THEIR RELIGION, THEIR FREEDOM, THEIR LIVES. WHAT SHOULD ONE EXPECT FROM THE HEIRS OF SUCH A SORRY INHERITANCE?
ANGER, OUTRAGE, VIOLENCE. THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED TO THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO LOST SO MUCH TO GAIN SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THEIRS IN THE FIRST PLACE...FREEDOM.
