 * 1:52:30 - https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Belgrano
 * Era curioso, porque Bola√±o s√≠ hab√≠a le√≠do a Aira. Y ten√≠a una buena opini√≥n de su obra. En Entre par√©ntesis, un libro en el que se compilan algunas de sus conferencias y art√≠culos period√≠sticos, afirma: ¬´Si hay actualmente un escritor que escapa a todas las clasificaciones, ese es C√©sar Aira, argentino de Coronel Pringles, ciudad de la provincia de Buenos Aires que no tengo m√°s remedio que aceptar como real, aunque parezca inventada por √©l, su hijo m√°s ilustre, el hombre que escribi√≥ las palabras m√°s l√∫cidas sobre la madre (un misterio verbal) y sobre el padre (una certeza geom√©trica), y cuya posici√≥n actual en lengua espa√±ola es tan complicada como lo fue la posici√≥n de Macedonio Fern√°ndez a principios de siglo. Digamos, para empezar, que Aira escribi√≥ uno de los cinco mejores cuentos que yo recuerde. El cuento se titula ¬´Cecil Taylor¬ª, y lo recoge Juan Forn en una antolog√≠a sobre la literatura argentina. Tambi√©n es el autor de cuatro novelas memorables [‚Ä¶]. Aira es un exc√©ntrico, pero tambi√©n uno de los tres o cuatro mejores escritores de hoy en lengua espa√±ola¬ª. It was curious [that Aira wouldn't read Bola√±o], because Bola√±o had indeed read Aira. And he had a good opinion of his work. https://www.jotdown.es/2016/07/paso-bolano-cesar-aira/ 
 * The Argentinian writer C√©sar Aira calls his method ‚Äúfuga hacia adelante,‚Äù which usually gets translated as ‚Äúflight forward‚Äù: he doesn‚Äôt go back to edit or revise what he‚Äôs written, instead he paints himself into corners and forces himself to escape, often employing surrealist imagery or an absurdist contrivance or a sudden change of genre. Like Fulgentius‚Äô play, there is clearly something autobiographical going on here. But again, like Fulgentius, he‚Äôs not all that interested in seeking an answer. He‚Äôs content to meander, and I‚Äôm content to let him. There‚Äôs clearly a connection between Aira‚Äôs flight forward method and Fulgentius‚Äô artistic undertakings, made obvious once you remember that Aira often refers to his collected work as a grand encyclopedia which he knows he‚Äôll never finish. But the frustrating thing is, there‚Äôs just not enough on Fulgentius‚Äô play to form develop this connection. Is Aira asking himself if he, like Fulgentius, has been defeated by (admittedly self-imposed) literary conventions? Every time it feels like we‚Äôre starting to get at something deeper, we‚Äôre off to the next thing. Typical Aira. https://adamsnotes.substack.com/p/fulgentius-cesar-airas-roman-generalhttps://adamsnotes.substack.com/p/fulgentius-cesar-airas-roman-general 
 * Aira's favorite Anglo author is Muriel Spark - maybe because she uses flashfowards? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muriel_Spark https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/week-fiction-barbara-epler-cesar-aira-2 And he also likes Raymond Roussel? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Roussel 
 * Where does Aira fit in among the many Spanish-language writers New Directions has published? Can you place him in a tradition, or is he completely sui generis? I think he fits in as a star within a constellation of our Spanish-language authors such as Borges, Bola√±o (who much admired ‚Äúthe incredible C√©sar Aira,‚Äù saying that he ‚Äúdefies all classification‚Äù), Bioy Casares, Cort√°zar, Mart√≠n Ad√°n, and Felisberto Hern√°ndez. I think they all have that elemental, irreducible, alchemical quality of genius. But within that constellation he is such a distinctly colored, flickering star. To me, the fact is that Aira takes sui generis to the level of soooo-eeeee PIGPIG genius. https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/week-fiction-barbara-epler-cesar-aira-2

Vorhanden, Zuhanden, and Dasein, three modes of being


Joscha, Kafka and : Matrixial Emergence: triads are what resolves dilemma, and tetralogies resolves trilemma, and so on..






Miller's interview concludes with 'setting a task' for Lacan to either 'reply' to the three Kantian questions: 'What can I know?', 'What ought I to do?' and 'What may I hope for?' or 'find a way of putting [the questions] differently'. In Lacan's view, it was not for the analyst to ask the Kantian questions, but rather to allow the subject to realise her position with respect to them. The fourth Kantian question 'What is man?' was never broached in this interview.

As Kimya Dawson so quaintly worded it, "having been fucked is no excuse for being fucked up."

// my fundamentals:
idleness/leisure/timenergy
to accept self-relating negativity is to accept yourself, your limit and identity to accept yourself vs live your life pathologically neurotically disheartened
Sigetik/Œ£ŒπŒ≥·æ∂ŒΩ/sig√¢n - Heidegger went on to develop a sigetics in his later work and the notion of bearing silence was central to it.
mimesis/diegesis: Plato contrasted mimesis, or imitation, with diegesis, or narrative
‚ÄúMemorial Address‚Äù - Heidegger expresses his concern that the primary cause of our inability to experience the full joy and peace of our existence is that we have abandoned the ability to think meditatively.

Mari Ruti: Drawing on the work of Eric Santner, Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek, and Alenka Zupanƒçiƒç, this paper constructs a theory of subjective singularity from a Lacanian perspective. It argues that, unlike the ‚Äúsubject‚Äù (who comes into existence as a result of symbolic prohibition), or the ‚Äúperson‚Äù (who is aligned with the narcissistic conceits of the imaginary), the singular self emerges in response to a galvanizing directive arising from the real.

Byung-Chul Han writes a lot of books (though they are closer to pamphlets), and they all revolve around three claims. ‚ë†First, negativity doesn‚Äôt exist anymore; it‚Äôs been replaced by positivity. ‚ë°Second, social violence has migrated from the outside to the inside, from suppression and restraint to motivation and psychology. ‚ë¢And third, the punctuation of human life by the erotic and aesthetic experience of the Other‚Äîin the jargon, ‚Äúradical alterity‚Äù‚Äîhas been replaced by an endless stream of narcissistic sameness. These forces combine to create a new kind of subject: ‚ÄúTwenty-first century society is no longer a disciplinary society, but rather an achievement society. Its inhabitants are no longer obedience-subjects. The positivity of Can is much more efficient than the negativity of Should.‚Äù

From Lacan's subject/object dialectic into the arm's of Heidegger's ontic/ontological (particular vs universalizing/totalizing)
‚Äòdas Man‚Äô (the They) and ‚Äòdas Gerede‚Äô (idle chatter/discourse). Heidegger is actually very critical of the kind of talk that produces truisms, platitudes, and so on. And his work is actually fundamentally opposed to maxims like ‚Äúbe true to yourself‚Äù/"live laugh love"!

Girardian - group conflict and scapgegoat theory - Girard - All conflict, competition and rivalry therefore originate in mimetic desire (mimetic rivalry), which eventually reaches destructive stages of conflict both between individuals and social groups that requires them to blame someone or something in order to defuse conflict through the scapegoat mechanism.

Sloterdijk - Daniel Tutt @DanielTutt ¬∑ 13h A philosophy as a way of life that teaches us how to live and transform this world is a direction I think socialist philosophers must develop. This is one thing I get from Sloterdijk, he's clear that `the greatest philosophers invent a distinct way of life in the culture.

subject qua pure void of self relating negativity, subject as self-relating negativity: For ≈Ωi≈æek, the subject is precisely that which breaks away from the dominance of the totalising Symbolic order. However, this ‚Äòbreaking away‚Äô is not (can not be) based on some vitality external to the symbolic, but the internal self-defeating character of the Symbolic. Hope that helps!

"dialectic" != "conversation": I think the first mistake would be equating dialectic with conversation: it‚Äôs the movement of a concept or social formations non-coincidence with itself. In Plato that takes the form of conversation but it doesn‚Äôt have to.

Pleeb notes:
never Tollowea tnrougn consistenty to is proper conclusion, even by Marxists tnemseives. From his correspondence it is possible to see how painful it was for Marx to find that even in party circles in Germany there was an almost unbelievable indifference to Capital. The immaturity of the German workers' movement of that time corresponds better to Lassalle's pamphlets than to the massive and brilliant structure of Marx's theory. Even the leading thinkers of the workers' movement were incapable of grasping the decisive aspects of Marx's theory. It is quite typical that W Liebknecht in 1868 requested Engels 'to clarify where the real difference lies between Marx and Lassalle‚Äô. So it is not difficult to understand why, as M Beer tells us today, that: down to 1882 and for some years afterwards, there was practically no trace of Marxism in Germany. The writings of Lassalle, the recollections of 1848 and French literature formed the real sources from which the movement drew for its theories, ideas and feelings. Many socialists had been trained by Rodbertus or Duhring, others were at best acquainted with the publications of the International Working Men's Association, and still others founded their demands on appeals to morality and humanity. Kautsky was the first to get through, little by little, with his popularization of Marx's ideas. (1923, p. 77)" So we are to take from this that Marx made little impact during his lifetime, was aware that his Capital was not being read, much less understood, and that important parts of it were not even published until after his death. So no wonder everyone gets it so wrong. I've been saying for a while now that every great thinker is misunderstood at the time and it takes a hundred years minimum for culture to digest and refine its exegeses. Grossman, Postman, Mattick, and Heinrich are three shining examples of this tendency to read Marx against "Marxisms" of the 2nd and 3rd Internationals. Taking Grossman as our case in point, he shows that Bauer, Hilferding, Lenin, and Kautsky, the biggest brains and voices of the 2nd

Daseinsanalysis - After World War II a form of Daseinsanalysis that differed from Binswanger's evolved in Zurich by Medard Boss. This new form of Daseinsanalysis focused on the practical application of Heidegger's phenomenology to the theory of neuroses and psychotherapy. Boss worked closely with Heidegger and in 1957, published a work that directly critiqued Freud, Jung, and Binswanger
Daseinsanalysis - Heidegger vs CharlesGuignon vs GraemeNicholson vs RolandKuhn 
Daseinsanalysis vs Heidegger's Zollikon Seminars??

Plato's error = essentialism is the enemy of truth. disassociating ideas from reality and regarding them as a second, "higher" reality to which our "lower," "imperfect" reality of matter and sensible things must conform. That‚Äôs not quite the same thing.; Abstractions including dreams are very real, they just aren't literal. That was Plato's error re: the Cave, theory of Forms, etc; I may of just committed Plato's error of the Ideal over the real.

In Heidegger's terminology, the being-there of the world (Dasein) cannot be essentially defined "by ascribing to it a 'what' that specifies its material content‚Äù. The ontological or existential thus have priority over the ontic and the existentiell
Heidegger's late work becomes increasingly preoccupied with the poetry of Holderlin, Rilke, and Trakl.

Brentano vs Aristotle: Brentano's argument is roughly as follows. Aristotle says: "Being is said in various ways." The several senses of being fit into a fourfold distinction: I) accidental being, 2) being in the sense of true being, 3) being of the categories, and 4) potential and actual being.

Levinas vs Gurwitsch or Ortega/Gasset - You should have gone with an Aron Gurwitsch or maybe Ortega y Gasset. Just my opinion, but Levinas is gobbly-goop.

The 30 Harshest Philosopher-on-Philosopher Insults in History
By Tom Hawking
July 24, 2014
Share:

We‚Äôve amused ourselves for a while now at Flavorwire with our ongoing survey of internecine mud-slinging in various areas of the arts: musicians, actors, authors, and filmmakers have all provided rich entertainment in the manifold ways they‚Äôve fought amongst themselves. But for truly epic bitchiness and egotism, you need look no further than that most storied and venerable of academic disciplines: philosophy! The history of Western thought is peppered with thinkers taking aim at their peers ‚Äî sometimes in a genteelly intellectual manner, and sometimes‚Ä¶ um, less so (yes, Friedrich Nietzsche, this means you). Here are 30 of the best, from Aristotle to ≈Ωi≈æek.


ü§å? Che vuoi? - Paradoxically, one should claim that Lacan's abandonment of 'intersubjectivity' is strictly correlative to the focusing of attention on the enigma of the impenetrable desire of the Other, epitomized in the phrase Che vuoi? (What do you want?). 9
For Che vuoi?, see: J. Lacan, The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire in the Freudian Unconscious, o.c., p. 312.. One should always bear in mind that the desire which is 'realized' (staged) in fantasy is not the subject's own, but the Other's desire. Fantasy, fantasmatic formation, is an answer to the enigma of Che vuoi?: 'You are saying this, but what is it that you effectively want by saying it?' This renders the subject's primordial, constitutive position. The original questioning of desire is not directly 'What do I want?,' but 'What do others want from me?, What do they see in me?, What am I for the others?'

// my major questions ???'s:
Nietzsche's coincidental eternal return vs OGRose's In conclusion, why have we decided to name this ‚ÄúNew Metaphysics‚Äù a ‚ÄúPhilosophy of Glimpses‚Äù versus a ‚ÄúPhilosophy of Glimmers?‚Äù Aren‚Äôt experiences of beauty, irony, ‚Äúflow,‚Äù and the like examples of ‚Äúglimmers?‚Äù Yes, but we must each decide, when we experience something ‚Äúdifferent,‚Äù if we indeed experienced something versus only think something caught our eye. By naming the ‚ÄúNew Metaphysics‚Äù a ‚ÄúPhilosophy of Glimpses,‚Äù the emphasis is on us to pay attention and remember what we know.

 * Marx+Freud - compare/contrast their negs! https://twitter.com/HZeavin/status/1537520013220773888
 * 30 VS: 30. Voltaire on Jean-Jacques Rousseau ‚ÄúI have read, monsieur, your new book against the human race. I thank you for it. No one has ever used so much intellect to prove us beasts. A desire seizes us to walk on four paws when we read your work. Nevertheless, as it is more than sixty years since I lost the habit, I feel, unfortunately, that it is impossible for me to resume it.‚Äù [via] 29. Rene Descartes on Blaise Pascal ‚ÄúMonsieur Pascal has too much vacuum in his brain.‚Äù [via] 28. Ralph Waldo Emerson on Henry Thoreau ‚ÄúHenry Thoreau is like the woodgod who solicits the wandering poet & draws him into antres [sic] vast & desarts [sic] idle, & bereaves him of his memory. & leaves him naked, plaiting vines & with twigs in his hand. Very seductive are the first steps from the town to the woods, but the End is want and madness.‚Äù [via] 27. Ludwig Wittgenstein on Bertrand Russell ‚ÄúRussell‚Äôs books should be bound in two colors, those dealing with mathematical logic in red ‚Äì and all students of philosophy should read them; those dealing with ethics and politics in blue ‚Äì and no one should be allowed to read them.‚Äù 26. Bertrand Russell on Aristotle ‚ÄúI do not agree with Plato, but if anything could make me do so, it would be Aristotle‚Äôs arguments against him.‚Äù [via] 25. Jean-Paul Sartre on Albert Camus ‚ÄúCamus‚Ä¶ a mix of melancholy, conceit and vulnerability on your part has always deterred people from telling you unvarnished truths. The result is that you have fallen prey to a gloomy immoderation that conceals your inner difficulties and which you refer to, I believe, as Mediterranean moderation. Sooner or later, someone would have told you this, so it might as well be me.‚Äù [via] 24. S√∏ren Kierkegaard on H.L. Martensen ‚ÄúMy opponent is a glob of snot.‚Äù [via] 23. Plato on Diogenes (In response to Diogenes lampooning Plato‚Äôs use of the terms ‚Äútableness‚Äù and ‚Äúcupness‚Äù to describe the properties of objects, and claiming that he could see a table and a cup, but nothing more): ‚ÄúThat is natural enough, for you have eyes, by which a cup and a table are contemplated; but you have not intellect, by which tableness and cupness are seen.‚Äù [via] 22. Anthony Kenny on Jacques Derrida ‚ÄúDerrida‚Ä¶ introduced new terms whose effect is to confuse ideas that are perfectly distinct.‚Äù [via] 21. Camille Paglia on Michel Foucault ‚ÄúThe truth is that Foucault knew very little about anything before the seventeenth century and, in the modern world, outside France. His familiarity with the literature and art of any period was negligible. His hostility to psychology made him incompetent to deal with sexuality, his own or anybody else‚Äôs. ‚Ä¶ The more you know, the less you are impressed by Foucault.‚Äù [via] 20. Alan Wolfe on Ayn Rand ‚ÄúIn the academy, she is a nonperson. Her theories are works of fiction. Her works of fiction are theories, and bad ones at that.‚Äù [via] 19. Bertrand Russell on Georg Hegel ‚ÄúHegel‚Äôs philosophy is so odd that one would not have expected him to be able to get sane men to accept it, but he did. He set it out with so much obscurity that people thought it must be profound. It can quite easily be expounded lucidly in words of one syllable, but then its absurdity becomes obvious.‚Äù [via] 18. Noam Chomsky on Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no ‚Äòtheory‚Äô in any of this stuff, not in the sense of theory that anyone is familiar with in the sciences or any other serious field. Try to find‚Ä¶ some principles from which you can deduce conclusions, empirically testable propositions where it all goes beyond the level of something you can explain in five minutes to a 12-year-old. See if you can find that when the fancy words are decoded. I can‚Äôt. So I‚Äôm not interested in that kind of posturing. ≈Ωi≈æek is an extreme example of it. I don‚Äôt see anything to what he‚Äôs saying.‚Äù [via] 17. Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek on Noam Chomsky ‚ÄúWell, with all deep respect that I do have for Chomsky, my‚Ä¶ point is that Chomsky, who always emphasizes how one has to be empirical, accurate‚Ä¶ well, I don‚Äôt think I know a guy who was so often empirically wrong.‚Äù [via] 16. Camille Paglia on Naomi Wolf ‚ÄúIf Naomi Wolf didn‚Äôt look the way she did, she would never have gotten any attention for [The Beauty Myth]. So it seemed hypocritical of her to be denouncing the beauty myth even while she was profiting from it.‚Äù [via] 15. Friedrich Nietzsche on John Stuart Mill ‚ÄúConsider, for example, the indefatigable, inevitable English utilitarians and with what clumsy and worthy feet they walk, stalk ‚Ä¶ along in the footsteps of Bentham. No new idea, no subtle expression or turn of an old idea, not even a real history of what had been thought before: an impossible literature altogether, unless one knows how to leaven it with a little malice.‚Äù [via] 14. Colin McGinn on Ted Honderich ‚ÄúHonderich does occasionally show glimmers of understanding that the problem of consciousness is difficult and that most of our ideas about it fall short of the mark. His instincts, at least, are not always wrong. It is a pity that his own efforts here are so shoddy, inept, and disastrous.‚Äù [via] 13. Ted Honderich on Colin McGinn ‚ÄúAt UCL we had a jokey locker-room relationship, but then I made a misstep. I suggested to him that his new girlfriend was not as plain as the old one, and I could see the blood drain out of his face. That was possibly the start of our frostiness.‚Äù [via] 12. Karl Popper on Ludwig Wittgenstein ‚ÄúNot to threaten visiting lecturers with pokers.‚Äù (On being challenged by a poker-wielding Wittgenstein to produce an example of a moral rule; the discussion degenerated quickly from there.) [via] 11. Thomas de Quincey on John Locke ‚ÄúAgainst Locke‚Äôs philosophy I think it an unanswerable objection that, although he carried his throat about with him in this world for 72 years, no man ever condescended to cut it.‚Äù [via] 10. Diogenes on Plato (Stamping all over Plato‚Äôs fancy carpet, Rick James style): ‚ÄúThus I trample on the pride of Plato!‚Äù [via] 9. Friedrich Nietzsche on Arthur Schopenhauer ‚ÄúSchopenhauer‚Ä¶ is for a psychologist a case of the first order: namely, a mendacious attempt of genius to marshal, in aid of a nihilistic total devaluation of life, the very counter-instances, the great self-affirmations of the ‚Äòwill to live‚Äô, the exuberant forms of life.‚Äù [via] 8. Karl Popper on Martin Heidegger ‚ÄúI appeal to the philosophers of all countries to unite and never again mention Heidegger or talk to another philosopher who defends Heidegger. This man was a devil. I mean, he behaved like a devil to his beloved teacher, and he has a devilish influence on Germany‚Ä¶ One has to read Heidegger in the original to see what a swindler he was.‚Äù [via] 7. Friedrich Nietzsche on Socrates ‚ÄúSocrates belonged by origin to the lowest folk; Socrates was rabble. One knows, one can still see for oneself, how ugly he was.‚Äù [via] 6. Noam Chomsky on the French, generally ‚ÄúFrench intellectual life has, in my opinion, been turned into something cheap and meretricious by the ‚Äòstar‚Äô system. It is like Hollywood. Thus we go from one absurdity to another ‚Äî Stalinism, existentialism. Lacan, Derrida ‚Äî some of them obscene (Stalinism), some simply infantile and ridiculous (Lacan, Derrida). What is striking, however, is the pomposity and self-importance, at each stage.‚Äù [via] 5. Isaac Newton on Robert Hooke ‚ÄúIf I have seen further than others, it was by standing on the shoulders of giants.‚Äù (The theory goes that Newton‚Äôs famous quote, contained in a letter to Hooke, was as much as anything else a dig at his arch-enemy, who was famously a hunchback and significantly shorter than Newton himself.) 4. Karl Marx on Jeremy Bentham ‚ÄúThe arch-philistine Jeremy Bentham was the insipid, pedantic, leather-tongued oracle of the bourgeois intelligence of the 19th century.‚Äù [via] 3. Rene Descartes on Gilles de Roberval ‚ÄúHe is as vain as a girl, has a head like a dwarf and behaves like the fool in an Italian farce who continues bragging and remains always victorious and invincible even after having his ears boxed and his face slapped with a slipper.‚Äù [via] 2. Friedrich Nietzsche on Immanuel Kant ‚ÄúThat most deformed concept-cripple of all time.‚Äù [via] 1. Arthur Schopenhauer on Georg Hegel ‚ÄúHegel, installed from above, by the powers that be, as the certified Great Philosopher, was a flat-headed, insipid, nauseating, illiterate charlatan who reached the pinnacle of audacity in scribbling together and dishing up the craziest mystifying nonsense.‚Äù

* age of positivity and era of narcissicism; otherness and negativity runs so counter to an age so obsessed with the self, making adjustments to identity and curating identity as a form of consumption, also makes it possible to understand what at theorist is talking about
 * it's not just meaning, its jouissance
* politics is just politics of enjoyment

Jodi Dean/Ernesto Laclau on Zizek

"unreadiness to hand", "breakdown to our own obstacles", "getting in our own way"

sublime object of ideology - "for they know not what they do" is very Hegelian
two alternates: jouissance of ideology, the real of ideology

"tarrying with the negative" - enjoy your nation as yourself

‚ÄãZizek doesn't take credit for concepts (eg ), so Zizek is the first philosopher king with true humility?

3 fold sstructure for law - why is law 3-fold / threefold structure - 3fold structure of law, explicit rules, implicit rules, inherent transgression

Imaginary is intuition/perception, Symbolic is for understanding (helps you look to Kant and Hegel), and the Real is Reason (Hegel does something diff with Reason than Kant did)

implicit rules are amendmeents to official rules

third Zizek: "superegoic obscene supplement" = "there are ways in which members of a society transgress both the implicit and explicit rules [..] forms of enjoyment, yet those that are disassociated at the official level helped to reproduce the ideological framework or the . but aids in reproductive in society, aids in reproduction in power dynamics, class antagonism, etc

our default setting is to link transgression to emancipation, in fact you're more shackled in transgression than mindlessly following explcity rules in society, trick in inherent transgression
when you do something officially opposed in society, it convinces you that you are free, oh yeah look at me i smoke weed at the rock concert

Bartleby, I would prefer a pure negation instead of resistance. if your juissance has source

I would prefer to not even have


"Emancipation after Hegel"

McGowan is easy to read. And Freud is easier to read than Lacan, Heidegger, or Levinas

it is jouissance that drives repetition, or, to put it otherwise, repetition strives for jouissance. 



libidinal coordinates
the real is something that cant be negated
"talk a sublime object into seduction" sublime object is ordinary object is what we project object petit A into

there's nothing libidinal or fantasmatic about Jews, its how Hitlers talked about them that sounds like they have excessive supplement "the jews took from us", jews have an "excessive dimension" in relation to enjoyment. its all concocted! but they get fixed into teh sublime psoition of excessive enjoyment based on how they were talked about

Lacan/sujet supose savoir/subject is supposed to know
Lacan/lathouse/we have an intensification of technological and aesthetic objects (industrially produced objects of consumption: movies, images, pornography, etc.) that sit in this position of agency for the desiring subject. Lacan coined the term lathouse to refer to these temporary objects that serve as stand-in‚Äôs for the object small a. This reminds me of Marcuse‚Äôs concept of negative sublimation, or sublimations that cathect the individual to repressive forms of domination.

Answer: There are regulations in hockey designed to stop players from moving in such a way where their skates excessively leave the ice (for this precise reason). Having seen the video of the incident, Matt Petgrave initiated a mid-ice hip check which caused him to tumble over his target and his skates to fly upwards. Adam Johnson happened to be in the worst possible place behind the player that was hit and subsequently died when hit throat was cut by Petgrave's skate. The hit itself was very odd and the high angle of Petgrave's hit compared to the target player's low posture (the player was bent forward trying to skate quickly) was out of the ordinary when it comes to what's normal, expected behaviour especially in a European game. Mid-ice collisions are common, but players will try to match the posture of their target if only to maximize the amount of contact area they have during the impact and making their hit more successful. This is also much safer, as you don't tumble in the way that happened during this incident. Petgrave did not do this for some reason. A release from the Yorkshire Police suggests they are still investigating but in the mean time Petgrave has been released. European countries approach arrests slightly differently than America where a suspect could sit in jail while an investigation is still ongoing. https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/17yg58x/what_is_going_on_with_the_manslaughter_charges_in/

* Scott Aaronson - add to profilicities? - If you take nothing else from this blog: quantum computers won't solve hard problems instantly by just trying all solutions in parallel. - https://scottaaronson.blog 
* Hey, I think you present some really interesting ideas. To kind of throw some other ideas out there to see what sticks, I'd like to mention that I share the same stance as you regarding MEs and confabulation by dreams, but I think I may have some valuable insight on the generation of true MEs by different mental states. I'm coming at this as a quantum computing engineer so I apologize if I get too technical, but if we assume the many worlds interpretation is true, then the "collapse" of a wavefunction can be explained by the entanglement of the observer's brain with the separate timelines, avoiding collapse. Thus the brain at any given time exists in an uncountably infinite set of possible states which move towards the attractors of the system, where traditionally the entropy of the system gives an approximation of how small the attractors are through the number of boundary conditions. Therefore, the higher the entropy, the less likely the attractors are to overlap and interfere, which corresponds exactly to how we perceive the collapse of a wavefunction in C√∂penhagen interpretation. Now, what happens when we consider different mental states with different entropy? When you enter deep sleep, your brain can be characterized by a slow oscillation of neurons firing across the brain like a kind of tribal rhythmn, characteristic of a low entropy system. As shown by the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser, wavefunction interference can persist even long after it has caused irreversible changes to a macroscopic system. What this means is that when you consider the chaos resulting from an infinite superposition of neural states, any time the brains from two or more superposed timelines fall into deep sleep at the same time they are very likely to influence each other via wave interference. This can and will affect formed associations and memories, but since the brain in deep sleep is in more or less a steady state, the differences won't be able to propagate very far for minimally varying brain states. When the brain starts to come out of deep sleep towards REM sleep the entropy increases back towards near-waking levels. This means wave interference is less likely to happen, but effects arising from waves that have already interfered are more likely to propagate farther through the brain in unpredictable ways. When you consider that these induced interference effects on firing neurons are in danger of becoming garbage collected or overwritten at any point, this means that any change from low entropy to high entropy brain states in the shortest amount of time will cause the greatest amount of noticeable crosstalk between superposed timelines. In other words, the amount of neural signal crosstalk depends on the rate at which one awakens from deep sleep. It is actually possible to place a lot of the Mandela Effect on a firm mathematical footing without resorting to philosophical/theological/supernatural woo, but unfortunately the gap in understanding between the layperson and the quantum researcher is so large that a lot of the time Buddhist/consciousness-first philosophies become necessary. https://www.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/5rf0c8/retroactive_dream_effects/dd7uoxx/

* grounding = underpinning = foundation; eg: When Nietzsche's mad man announces the death of God, he is acutely aware that no one is yet capable of understanding the scope of this death of all deaths. What Nietzsche foresees here is arguably where we find ourselves today: an age of hyper-morality entirely ungrounded, as its foundation has disappeared. Nietzsche foresees that liberalism will take on Christian morality and sentiments but without its metaphysical underpinnings and commitments. Such a morality goes into overdrive precisely because it has no foundation. This might explain the mad freakout of the herds today.

Jhani - The Buddha‚Äôs teachings can be divided into three parts: sila, samadhi, and panna (ethical conduct, concentration, and wisdom). Or to put it into the vernacular: clean up your act, concentrate your mind, and use your concentrated mind to investigate reality.
neti neti - (‡§®‡•á‡§§‡§ø ‡§®‡•á‡§§‡§ø) is a Sanskrit expression which means "not this, not this", or "neither this, nor that" (neti is sandhi from na iti "not so"). It is found in the Upanishads Neti neti,is the method of Vedic analysis of negation. It is a keynote of Vedic inquiry. With its aid the Jnani negates identification with all things of this world which is not the Atman, in this way he negates the Anatman. Through this gradual process he negates the mind and transcends all worldly experiences that are negated till nothing remains but the Self. He attains union with the Absolute by denying the body, name, form, intellect, senses and all limiting adjuncts and discovers what remains, the true "I" alone

Transversality does nothing less than schizophrenize the transference. Transversality is a conceptual and clinical tool that was developed primarily in Guattari‚Äôs thought, activism and practice, and which he borrowed from Sartre, as a concept designed to transform institutions, beginning with the psychiatric hospital. Transversality is a key concept for the ongoing genealogies of new materialism whose rhizomatic history is rooted in Deleuze and Guattari‚Äôs two-volume Capitalism and Schizophrenia

We could not cover all 13 episodes in one sitting, so we picked Layers 01 (Weird), 07 (Society), 09 (Protocol), 10 (Love) and 12 (Landscape). Very pleased with how these two hours fit together into a cohesive arc, with very little exposition](https://x.com/Plinz/status/1804314799175803314)

* LA SILICONIZACI√ìN DEL MUNDO por Eric Sadin - ,Es un libro interesant√≠simo, por una letra no podemos decir que de lo que se trata es de una verdadera "silicolonizaci√≥n", porque justo eso es lo que se juega en este libro, la indicaci√≥n de que lo que acontece es una colonizaci√≥n, mediante la transformaci√≥n de las subjetividades. Si hay un imperio √©ste es el de Facebook as√≠ como las consecuencias de ello.
* Este libro demuestra que cualquier teor√≠a de la v√≠ctima debe, por principio, declinar de representar qui√©n es la v√≠ctima y comenzar por pensar acorde a lo que Laruelle denomina la determinaci√≥n-en-√∫ltima-instancia de la v√≠ctima hacia el intelectual. La v√≠ctima hace declinar el honor medi√°tico del intelectual y habilita as√≠, junto a el, las condiciones para lo que Laruelle nombra como la 'insurrecci√≥n' del 'cuerpo glorioso' de la v√≠ctima o el hombre-en-persona. A pesar de la complejidad del libro por sus pre suposiciones hist√≥rico-filos√≥ficas y conceptuales y el trabajo con nociones y formas de pensamiento de la teor√≠a cu√°ntica, la propia no-filosof√≠a de Francois Laruelle supone que todo material escrito es en primer lugar una matriz de datos dispuestas a ser usadas en una esfera neutral o extra√±a. Desde ah√≠, recomiendo con toda energ√≠a la revisi√≥n de este libro, su exploraci√≥n y posterior uso, aunque sean como fragmentos de pensamientos repartidos, y en principio confusos, de la v√≠ctima y los posibles de su justicia. 1,033 / 5,000 Translation results This book demonstrates that any theory of the victim must, as a matter of principle, decline from representing who the victim is and start thinking along what Laruelle calls the victim's ultimate determination of the intellectual. The victim makes the media honor of the intellectual decline and thus enables, together with him, the conditions for what Laruelle names as the 'insurrection' of the 'glorious body' of the victim or the man-in-person. Despite the book's complexity in its historical-philosophical and conceptual presuppositions and work with quantum theory notions and ways of thinking, Francois Laruelle's own non-philosophy assumes that all written material is first and foremost a matrix of data ready to be used in a neutral or strange sphere. From there, I strongly recommend the review of this book, its exploration and subsequent use, even if they are fragments of distributed thoughts, and initially confused, of the victim and the possible justice for her.

# Heidegger/Freud/Lacan/etc vocabulary words
* Abhanden is the contrary to "vorhanden", which means "present". The literal translation of "vorhanden" would be - as you already might have guessed - "before hand", but it does not mean beforehand, but rather at hand. So "vorhanden" is something which is present to be used, to be taken in hand. And "abhanden" is quite the contrary "off hand", absent. (Also see Pfeifer)
* allm√§chtige - "Das allm√§chtige Leben" by Uexk√ºll, Jakob von
* andeven freigeben, ‚Äúto set-free.‚Äù
* Anklang - Resonating = RESONATING IS A form of indirect GIVENNESS of BEING or, in Heidegger‚Äôs terminology of the 1930s and 1940s, of BEYNG. More precisely, it is not beyng that is experienced in the resonating, but rather the lack of beyng. https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-heidegger-lexicon/resonating-anklang/151A44D9072AB06D0E286BD94AB0B3D6

* Aufhebung/Aufheben = sublation
* Aufschreibesysteme can be translated to English as "Recording Systems" or "Note-taking Systems." The term is composed of "Aufschreiben," which means "to record" or "to take notes," and "Systeme,". It's a book by Kittler, a neologism he borrowed from his patient Schreber
* Augenblicke = moments. Werd ich zum Augenblicke sagen: Verweile doch! du bist so sch√∂n! Dann magst du mich in Fesseln schlagen, Dann will ich gern zugrunde gehn!

Coined by German linguist Heinz Kloss in 1967.."DACH" = Composed of the translingual country codes D (‚ÄúGermany‚Äù), A (‚ÄúAustria‚Äù) and CH (‚ÄúSwitzerland‚Äù), punning on Dachsprache (‚Äúumbrella language‚Äù, see Dach ‚Äúroof‚Äù).
* 'das Ereignis' (the Event) vs 'das Man' (the They) and ‚Äòdas Gerede‚Äô (idle chatter/discourse) - Das Man: "Das Man" translates to "The They" or "The Public" in English. Heidegger introduced this concept to describe the everyday, impersonal, and conformist mode of existence that characterizes much of human social life. It represents the influence of societal norms, expectations, and conventions on individuals. "Das Man" signifies a state of being where individuals conform to the norms of society, often without authentic reflection or self-examination. It reflects a mode of existence that lacks individuality and often involves going along with what is expected by the collective. Das Ding: "Das Ding" translates to "The Thing" in English. Heidegger's concept of "Das Ding" goes beyond the everyday understanding of a physical object. It delves into the ontological nature of things and how they are encountered by human beings. Heidegger emphasizes that a thing's significance is not solely based on its utility or appearance but on how it reveals itself to us in our existential encounter. He encourages us to consider the essence of things and their role in revealing aspects of our existence.

* Erfahrung - experience; Philosophy would be this same reading of meaning carried out to its conclusion, an exact science, the sole exact one, because it alone goes all the way in the effort to know what Nature and History and the World and Being are, when our contact with them is not only the partial and abstract contact of the physical experiment and calculation, or of the historical analysis, but the total contact of someone who, living in the world and in Being, means to see his life fully, particularly his life of knowledge, and who, an inhabitant of the world, tries to think himself in the world, to think the world in himself, to unravel their jumbled essences, and to form finally the signification "Being." ** What is true here: what is not nothing is something, but: this something is not hard as a diamond, not unconditioned, Erfahrung (Maurice Merleau-Ponty - The Visible and the Invisible (1969).pdf);;; m√∂gliche Erfahrung = possible experience; Absolute/Convinced Individual, True power manifests when the ‚ÄòI‚Äô ceases to act ‚Äòin accordance with necessity‚Äô; Kant, Schelling, Fichte, and Vico's gnoseology, distorted shadows, transcendental ‚ÄòI‚Äô, neo-Hegelian idealism developed by philosophers Giovanni Gentile and Benedetto Croce, Giovanni Gentile, Hermann Keyserling, Octave Hamelin, and Otto Braun, Carlo Michelstaedter, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Otto Weininger, path of persuasion, Œ¨ŒΩœÑœÅœâœÄŒøœÇ Œ¨œÅœÅŒ∑œÑŒøœÇ, Decio Calvari, Lao Tzu's Dao De Jing, immanentisation of the transcendent https://arktos.com/2023/06/17/julius-evolas-magical-idealism/ 
* fortgew√§hren / fortw√§hren = [to grant permanently]/[to endure permanently - All essencing endures. But is enduring only permanent enduring? Does the essence of technology endure in the sense of the permanent enduring of an Idea that hovers over everything technological, thus making it seem that by technology we mean some mythological abstraction? The way in which technology essences lets itself be seen only on the basis of that permanent enduring in which enframillg comes to pass as a destining of revealing. Goethe [313] once uses the mysterious word fortgew√§hren [to grant permanently] in place of fortw√§hren [to endure permanently]. He hears w√§hren [to endure] and gew√§hren [to grant] here in one unarticulated accord. And if we now ponder more carefully than we did before what it is that properly endures and perhaps alone endures, we may venture to say: only what is granted endures. What endures primacy out of the earliest beginning is what grants. - The Question Concerning Technology

* Jargon der Eigentlichkeit/Jargon of Authenticity (Adorno), as a direct reference to Heidegger‚Äôs Being and Time, points both to the rhetoric and ideology of this tendency. Yet, Adorno‚Äôs text doesn‚Äôt primarily target Heidegger, but rather his imitators, who adopt his terminology without the philosophical originality of his thought ‚Äî which Adorno does not overlook. Heidegger‚Äôs role within the Jargon of Authenticity is nevertheless ambivalent, as his idealisation of the rural and archaic, as much as his exaltation of singular words, feed such vulgarisations. After all, Heidegger is also guilty of clouding such Germanic and rather untranslatable words like Geborgenheit (shelteredness), Anruf (appeal), Begegnung (encounter), Anliegen (concern) in a mystified aura (cf. ibid., 6). https://epochemagazine.org/26/revisiting-adornos-jargon-of-authenticity-1964/
* die Kehre, zur√ºckzukehren (The Turn, The Return) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heideggerian_terminology
* Kunsttriebe "artistic impulses" Nietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that transcended the pessimism found in the so-called wisdom of Silenus. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. The main theme in The Birth of Tragedy is that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian Kunsttriebe ("artistic impulses") forms dramatic arts or tragedies. He argued that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity, logic and the principle of individuation, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion, ecstasy and unity (hence the omission of the principle of individuation). Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other, formed principles that were fundamental to the Greek culture:[3][4] the Apollonian a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian a state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries. In this mould, a man appears as the satyr. He is the horror of the annihilation of the principle of individuality and at the same time someone who delights in its destruction.[5]

* Lichtung = Heidegger's clearing/lighting; Other utterly strange teachings to follow. Personality is the threshold of Dasein. And allows a royal road to Ereignis or, what is "the same"/"Gleich", Lichtung or clearing at the moment of the Da as against the logos sun.
* M√§ngelswesen - Spinal Catastrophism.pdf - In 1940, Arnold Gehlen (1904‚Äì1976), a key figure in philosophical anthropology, published his Der Mensch: Seine Natur und seine Stellung in der Welt. Therein, he picks up on Nietzsche‚Äôs dictum that humans are the ‚Äònot-yet-determined‚Äô or ‚Äònot-yet-finished‚Äô being, as well as Herder‚Äôs notion that we are the ‚Äòcreature of deficiencies‚Äô (M√§ngelswesen).18 Gehlen emphasizes that ‚Äò[f]rom a biological point of view, in comparison to animals, the structure of the human body appears to be a paradox and stands out sharply‚Äô.19 Our ‚Äòupright gait‚Äô‚Äîthat ‚Äòspecial morphological position‚Äô‚Äîis the central feature of ‚Äòthe peculiar human bodily structure‚Äô, expressing the fact that our species is characterized ‚Äòby deficiencies‚Äô and ‚Äòlack of adaptations‚Äô. And yet, such an inheritance of underdetermination is not only an endowment of ‚Äòplasticity‚Äô (Plastizitat) but also precisely a summons to ‚Äòaction‚Äô. For, to the extent that ‚Äòman‚Äô is ‚Äòundetermined‚Äô, according to Gehlen, ‚Äòhis very body presents a problem and challenge to him‚Äô, and, concordantly, he is spurred to ‚Äòdevelop an attitude toward himself and make something of himself‚Äô.

* Nachtr√§glichkeit (aftwardness deferred action, retroaction, apr√®s-coup, https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/13n4lbl/im_a_12_second_old_amoeba_living_in_the_water/) The forth movement has nothing to do with the principle of sufficient reason, but nachtr√§glichkeit. The retroactivity of sublation which is the vanishing mediator. https://www.instagram.com/p/Ctw7n_aOzIB also Dr. Leon Brenner discussion https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKYWNGHV6ug&t=4178s Andrew is referring here to "Nachtr√§glichkeit" which I think (I don't know German) can translate to "deferred action" or "retroactivity" -- this is an important concept for Freud and Lacan. Basically, retroactivity implies an experience in the present altering the meaning of a past action. In the case of Freud's wolf man, for example, he witnesses his parents having sex "coitus a tergo" as a child and thinks nothing of it. It's only years later when he's going through his own pubescent sexual awakening and becoming a sexual being in his own right that this witnessed scene ("the primal scene") becomes traumatic for him. So the nature of "Nachtr√§glichkeit" is traumatic for the reason that it alters the meaning of past events and/or conjures forgotten memories. These memories take on a new meaning that in some sense changes the composition of the subject's entire psychic framework. How is this possible? Well, the scene witnessed may not have been traumatic at the time, but because the "mature" subject happens to suffer a fresh trauma at a later date in his life, a gap in the narrativization in his life is reopened and the previously neutral scene comes to fill in that gap (i.e. the gap of the real). Implicated therewith is the whole of the symbolic order which now must be rearranged. This is why trauma is not merely an unpleasant episode in a stream of otherwise undifferentiated experience, but rather a scene (however brutal) which is inserted into the gap in order to rectify the continuity of egoic experience. The truly originary traumatic moment is, however, consubstantial with one's entrance into the symbolic order. If the subject is that which the symbolic order cannot fully assimilate (because the symbolic order necessarily hinges on the absence of one signifier), then real trauma sustained by the individual can be equated to the (mythic) moment one becomes a "parletre", a speaking being or a subject of language. The signifier is traumatic for the subject in the same way that the subject is, for the symbolic order itself, a traumatic excess. The imaginary confers a sort of uniformity to conscious experience. When one befalls an unfamiliar event, the shock of it is such that there is a kind of time-loop which occurs. This time-loop we could only call retroactive in that it disturbs the time of the ego (which is linear) and brings to the fore the time of the subject (which cannot account for itself as it is co-identical with that which cannot be accounted for by the symbolic order) in its impossible, "kairotic" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos) dimension. I hope that was somewhat clear. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterwardsness Herausforderungen der Nachtr√§glichkeit = challenges of hindsight, In essence, "Nachtr√§glichkeit" suggests a malleable understanding of the past that can evolve over time, while "Nachhinein" describes the act of retrospectively viewing events from a fixed point in time using the information available at that point.

* Sagen as Zeigen = Telling/Naming as Showing Why is Lacan not a Heideggerian ? (self.zizek) submitted 4 days ago * by Agreeable_Bluejay424 In Zizek's book entitled "Less than nothing" in the chapter "Why Lacan is not a Heideggerian " Zizek argues that Lacan's concept of psychosis is related to Heideggerian concept of disclosure of Beign. In a risky interpretive move, Lacan links this "primary" symbolization which is accessible to psychotics and which precedes the subjective engagement they lack to Heidegger's distinction between the originary dimension of language as the disclosure of Being and the dimension of speech as the bearer of (subjective) significations or as a means of intersubjective recognition. At this originary level of naming as showing (Sagen as Zeigen), the difference between signiflcation and reference falls away, a word which names a thing does not "mean" it, it constitutes or discloses it in its Being, it opens up the space of its existence. This level is the level of appearing as such, not appearance as opposed to reality beneath it, but "pure" appearing which "is" entirely in its appearing, behind which there is nothing. In his seminar psychoses, Lacan provides a nice description of such pure appearing and of the concomitant, properly metaphysical temptation to reduce it to its ground, to its hidden causes: The rainbow, it is just that [c'est la]. And this it is just that implies that we will engage ourselves to our last breath to learn what is hidden behind it, what is the cause to which we can reduce it. Note how what from the very beginning characterizes the rainbow and the meteor and everybody knows this, since it is for this reason that we call it a meteor is precisely that there is nothing hidden behind. It is entirely in this appearance. What makes it persist for us, to the point that we never cease to ask questions about it, consists solely in the originary it is just that, that is to say, in the nomination as such of the rainbow. There is nothing else but this name. Could someone please try to explain this passage, especially what is the Heideggerian concept that he is refering to and how it relates to Lacan please? https://www.reddit.com/r/zizek/comments/16zxt93/why_is_lacan_not_a_heideggerian/

That‚Äôs not the same as saying it‚Äôs untranslatable, but it is peculiarly pinched.

* Untergang - Heidegger praised Hitler and Mussolini for having ‚Äúintroduced a countermovement to [European] nihilism‚Äù‚Äî‚Äútechnology,‚Äù ‚Äúcivilization,‚Äù das Man, etc.thereby reaffirming his ‚Äúmetapolitical‚Äù expectation that fascism alone possessed the capacity to redeem the West from the fate of ‚Äúdecline‚Äù (Untergang) prophesied by a litany of conservative revolutionary Zivilisationskritiker, such as Oswald Spengler, Carl Schmitt, and Ernst J√ºnger. Similarly, in 1961, when Heidegger‚Äôs highly regarded Nietzsche lectures were published by Neske Verlag, the philosopher stealthily excised a scathing critique of democracy that was contained in the original manuscript. Democracy, insisted Heidegger, was little more than ‚Äúan expression of nihilism.‚Äù Channeling Nietzsche and other critics of ‚Äúmass society,‚Äù he excoriated democratic rule as ‚Äúthe devaluation of the highest values, to the point where they have [‚Ä¶] ceased to be constructive forces. Hence, ‚Äòthe ascendancy of the rabble,‚Äô ‚Äòthe social mishmash‚Äô of ‚Äòequal men.‚Äô‚Äù Undoubtedly, Heidegger hoped that by excluding these passages, he could forestall yet another public debate concerning his unsavory political past. Given these views, it is little wonder that, in recent years, Heidegger‚Äôs thought has found such favor among proponents of the transatlantic ‚ÄúNew Right‚Äù: dubious disciples such as Russia‚Äôs Aleksandr Dugin, France‚Äôs Alain de Benoist, the AfD‚Äôs Bj√∂rn H√∂cke, and former Trump advisor Steve Bannon. In a 2018 profile in Der Spiegel by Christoph Scheuermann, Bannon is shown handling ‚Äúa biography of the philosopher Martin Heidegger. ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs my guy,‚Äô Bannon says. Heidegger, he says, had some good ideas on the subject of being, which fascinates him.‚Äù Bannon, Scheuermann writes, ‚Äújumps from the depths of politics to the heights of philosophy, from the swamp to Heidegger in five seconds. What sets us apart from animals or rocks, Bannon asks? What does it mean to be human? How far should digital progress go?‚Äù;;;Dert Untergang des Abendlandes = Spengler's The Decline of the West
* Veranlassen - The Question of Technology. pdf In order to guard against such misinterpretations of being responsible and being indebted, let us clarify the four ways of being responsible in terms of that for which they are responsible. According to our example, they are responsible for the silver chalice's lying ready before us as a sacrificial vessel. Lying before and lying ready (hypokeisthai) characterize the presenting of something that is present. The four ways of being responsible bring something into appearance. They let it come forth into presencing [Anwesen]. They set it free to that place and so start it on its way, namely, into its complete arrival. The principal characteristic of being responsible is this starting something on its way into arrival. It is in the sense of such a starting something on its way into arrival that being responsible is an occasioning or an inducing to go forward [Ver-an-lassen]. On the basis of a look at what the Greeks experienced in being responsible, in aitia, we now give this verb "to occasion" a more inclusive meaning, so that it now is the name for the essence of causality thought as the Greeks thought it. The common and narrower meaning of "occasion," in contrast, is nothing more than a colliding and releasing, and means a kind of secondary cause within the whole of causality. https://www2.hawaii.edu/~freeman/courses/phil394/The%20Question%20Concerning%20Technology.pdf

Now, ‚Äúforgetting is an elementary mode of temporality in which we are primarily and for the most part our own having-been.‚Äù‚Äù? https://twitter.com/Wired73813850/status/1761533232200183905/photo/2

* Vorstellung = Kant's word for representation/introduction/performance; Vorstellung. The normal translation of this term is ‚Äúrepresentation.‚Äù But Hegel uses it in different contexts in two quite distinct senses ‚Äì in a generic sense that would include the specific type of representation which is the concept; and in a narrower sense which is normally associated with ‚Äúimagination‚Äù and is opposed to ‚Äúconcept.‚Äù In this last sense, it can be translated in a variety of ways ‚Äì for instance, as ‚Äúordinary representation,‚Äù ‚Äúfigurative representation,‚Äù or ‚Äúrepresentation of the imagination.‚Äù;;;Vorstellung v ixiptla: The Nahuatl word is ixiptla, or image: the sacrifice becomes a representation of the deity. - https://harpers.org/archive/2023/11/overwhelming-and-collective-murder-rene-girard/ ;;; Vorstellung vs Darstellung Rocco Gangle's "Diagrammatic Immanence - Category Theory and Philosophy" - Diagrams are the appropriate method for InvestigatIng Immanence Immanently - Diagrams imply a partial blurring of the distinction between sense and notation, or between object and sign. In other words, dia- grams are essentially iconic. They are what they mean. One effect of the seldom questioned linguistic dominance in philosophical method is that the peculiar and restricted form of semiotic relation that holds generally between words (or sentences) and things (or propositions, states of affairs and so forth) is often transferred uncritically to the relation between thought and what thought thinks. Diagrammatic thought is situated on a terrain wherein problems of linguistic sig- nification and representation are relatively circumscribed from the outset. This is because diagrams are constituted always to some degree by a mode of representation (Vorstellung) that is also an ‚Äòimmediate‚Äô non-linguistic presentation (Darstellung), for instance via sense perception or physical movement. If Vorstellung is the mark of the transcendent sign, Darstellung tends intrinsically towards a model of immanent signification, meaning not necessarily the simple identity of sign and thing, but their at least minimal overlap and ontological continuity. Diagrams thus represent systems of relations and at the same time instantiate (at least some of) those relations directly. In this way the ‚Äòcontent‚Äô of a diagram is already at least partly present directly and immediately in its ‚Äòform‚Äô. Its syntax is already an instance of its semantics.

The designation "Wehrmacht" replaced the previously used term Reichswehr and was the manifestation of the Nazi regime's efforts to rearm Germany to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted. https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/17esdxz/mentally_girarded/k669dfr/ 
* Widerhall/Wiederhall - Echo - The meaning of the "clearing" is discussed in the introduction and in Chapter Four. Original thought is the echo (Widerhall) of the favour (Gunst) of Being in which what is unique (das EinZige) clears itself and lets itself occur: that being is. Echo: the constant interplay between being and be-ing as not granting, or self-sheltering. In this chapter, Heidegger discusses the necessary ills of machination, the gigantic, and calculation, which out of the history of metaphysics reduce the question of be-ing to the belief that all beings ‚Äî the focus of metaphysics ‚Äî are created, reproducible, and entirely explainable. This is "necessary" because it is always already a part of the history of the first beginning, and the only thing distressing enough to potentially lead to a more originary distress, which leads to the creative question of be-ing. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributions_to_Philosophy FREEDOM AND THE FOURFOLD IN THE THOUGHT OF MARTIN HEIDEGGER.pdf !! https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/13936/1/fulltext.pdf bing/chatgpt: Heidegger‚Äôs term for Echo in German is ‚ÄúWiederhall‚Äù 1.

* When Wittgenstein was stationed in Krak√≥w in the winter of 1914-15, he found it difficult to work. His thoughts were ‚Äútired‚Äù (m√ºde). "It is as if a flame has been extinguished and I must wait till it begins to burn again of its own accord."
* Sollen vs Wollen (Ought vs Wish) - The logic of Sollen (ought) is the infinite approach to the ultimately unattainable Ideal. But in what sense is the moral ought an unattainable Ideal? Helmut Holzhey & Vilem Mudroch's definition of the Kantian ought (Sollen) is helpful. OUGHT (Sollen). Applies to humans as beings that belong both to the realm of sensibility and to the realm of reason. Reason produces moral law which would be automatically binding for all beings that belonged solely to the realm of reason; whatever that law dictated would automatically be willed by such beings. Humans, however, are also motivated by desires or inclinations produced by their sensibility that are in conflict with moral law, so that they must attempt to overcome these desires, and the moral law does not automatically motivate them. Thus the moral law is an imperative, with which an ought (Sollen) and not a wish (Wollen) is expressed. (Historical Dictionary of Kant and Kantianism, pp. 202-3) Ok, here's the point: what is impossible, for humans, about morality, about the ought, is that the source of the motivations behind our acts is split between the ought (Sollen) and the wish (Wollen). Our will is divided between pure morality (categorical imperative) and empirics-pathological impulses. In other words, we do automatically and perfectly act on the basis of the moral law. The unattainable Ideal would be a pure will that always acts in accordance with the categorical imperative. The pursuit of moral perfection is an "infinite approach" precisely because we do not and can not automatically act in perfect alignment with the moral law. We are beings torn between Sollen and Wollen.
* "Like Benjamin‚Äôs notion of messianism, Heidegger‚Äôs faktisches Leben would anticipate and pave the way to a new non-relational politics."
* Leitfrage: Heidegger speaks of the fact that if the "leading question of philosophy" (Leitfrage) was a question about the essence (as a common property) of beings, then the "basic - lying at the basis - question of philosophy" (Grundefrage) must become the question of the truth of being (√ºber Wahrheit des Seyns: what is at issue is Seyn with a "y"). 
* We shall call that sending-that-gathers [versammelde Schicken] which first starts man upon a way of revealing, destining [Geschick].21 It is from out of this destining that the essence of all history [Geschichte] is determined.

[See Vom Wesen der Wahrheit, 1930; 1st ed., 1943, pp. 16 ff. [English translation, ‚ÄúOn the Essence of Truth,‚Äù in Existence and Being, ed. Werner Brock (Chicago: Regnery, 1949), pp. 308 ff.] And it is only the destining into objectifying representation that makes the historical accessible as an object for historiography, i.e., for a science, and on this basis makes -

* Unverborgenheit ‚ÄúUnconcealment,‚Äù ‚ÄúUnverborgenheit,‚Äù was a term that first entered Heidegger‚Äôs philosophy as a translation for the ancient Greek word al√™theia. The more standard translation of al√™theia is ‚Äútruth‚Äù (Wahrheit in German), but Heidegger elected to go with a literal translation: a-l√™theia means literally ‚Äúnot-concealed.‚Äù He did this because he believed the early Greeks thought of ‚Äútruth‚Äù as primarily a matter of ‚Äúmaking available as unconcealed, as there out in the open, what was previously concealed or covered up‚Äù (see GA 63: 12). In Greek mythology, Lethe (/ÀàliÀêŒ∏iÀê/; Ancient Greek: ŒõŒÆŒ∏Œ∑ L·∏óthƒì; Ancient Greek: [l…õÃåÀêt ∞…õÀê], Modern Greek: [ÀàliŒ∏i]), also referred to as Lesmosyne, was one of the five rivers of the underworld of Hades. Also known as the Amelƒìs potamos (river of unmindfulness), the Lethe flowed around the cave of Hypnos and through the Underworld where all those who drank from it experienced complete forgetfulness. Lethe was also the name of the Greek spirit of forgetfulness and oblivion, with whom the river was often identified. In Classical Greek, the word lethe (ŒªŒÆŒ∏Œ∑) literally means "oblivion", "forgetfulness", or "concealment".[1] It is related to the Greek word for "truth", aletheia (·ºÄŒªŒÆŒ∏ŒµŒπŒ±), which through the privative alpha literally means "un-forgetfulness" or "un-concealment".

* "Shanzhai" (fortress / knockoff) vs "Cha bu duo" (close enough / good enough / not far off), "Â±±ÂØ®" vs "Â∑Æ‰∏çÂ§ö" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanzhai https://old.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/11lxrx1/china_doesnt_care_about_copyright_will_china/
* neigga - I am a white American who is a Chinese teacher in a mostly Black school in the US. I dread when it comes time to teach ÈÇ£‰∏™/Âì™‰∏™ . The students take this opportunity to twist the word into some immature racial nonsense. Furthermore , the Chinese word ,ÈÇ£‰∏™Ôºå when spoken in standard Mandarin in either version, sounds nothing like the ‚Äún‚Äù word the way they normally use it but they feel they have make a big deal out of it . The class erupts into all kinds of useless discussions about how the word sounds and some pretend to be offended . All I do is tell them that this is the way it is and I‚Äôm going to keep saying it whether they like it or not. So is ÈÇ£‰∏™offensive to them ? I don‚Äôt care. The word means ‚Äúthat‚Äù.
