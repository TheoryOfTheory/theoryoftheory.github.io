I'm a veteran of the great war against the Correct the Record shills on r politics (I have micro-PTSD in the sense that I still don't type "CTR" without signing-out and double-checking that I wasn't ghostbanned, a time-consuming activity no less), that was one of my more meaningful formative experiences which inform pretty much everything that happens to me to this day on reddit and virtually all online platforms. There's even a polemical concept called "heavenbanning" now that is now informing me.

Baudrillard would have such a field day with these new phenomena we're experiencing, I know Mark Fisher / Nick Land sure did. To my dumbass tho, whenever I look at my phone it's like there's no immediacy to knowing what's real: Who is a bot? Who is an NPC pushing unconscious agenda? Etc..

It's like we have to develop our own Turing test for the modern era that involves psychoanalysis and comedy in order to be able to exchange meaningful information with strangers online today, which is why I feel like a lot of conspiracy-minded folks congregate in those channels
