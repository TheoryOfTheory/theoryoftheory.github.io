<li>Spinal Catastrophism.pdf - &quot;Bataille locates in man’s spinal realignment merely a more refined lasciviousness—a more violent voluptuousness. To wit, he pinpoints ‘Two Terrestrial Axes’: the ‘vertical’, which ‘prolongs the radius of the terrestrial sphere’ as axis of libertine escape, lorded by ocean tides and plants (which ‘flee’ the earth to sacrifice themselves ‘endlessly’ to the Sun’s downward onslaught); and the ‘horizontal’, domicile to beasts and ‘analogous to the turning of the earth’. ‘Only human beings’, Bataille notes, ‘tearing themselves away from peaceful animal horizontality’, have ‘succeeded in appropriating the vegetal erection’, surrendering themselves to exquisite upwards collapse towards outer space’s solar enormities and fluxions.&quot; Kant had linked the terrestrial-spinal axis to self-orienting rationality, but for Bataille the excremental effluence of the simian anus is merely rerouted upward—‘blossoming with the most delirious richness of forms’—in the ostentatious bulbing of the sapient cranium, a most exotic and wanton flower. The surging gradient of expenditure migrates from digestive-horizontal slope to the more intensified zenith-realm of intelligences. And yet, as Bataille notes, this upward-thrusting ‘liberation of man’ is somewhat end-stopped or bottlenecked by the skull’s right angle. Like the swell of a kinked hose, the perpendicular brain-cap is a ballooning instability. Along with Reich and Ferenczi, Bataille notes that in laughter, coitus, and torment this blockage in the solar-spinal surge is relieved: we assume free-flowing continuity with celestial potlatch. He wrote that ‘human life is bestially concentrated in the mouth’.</li>

India's discourse was predominated by darshana (insight or understanding); while China's was predominated by the Tao (the proper Way to be in the world). Indian philosophy was transmitted to China via Buddhism in the third century but the Chinese philosophy didn't really transmit the other way, though it did disseminate to Korea and Japan along with Buddhism where it was further even more broadly reinterpreted. Virtually all the same subjects that are common to the western discourse are present in the eastern: metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, ethics, etc. No they don't necessarily receive the same labels and are not as strictly categorized. Each of these millennial long topics of thought in these regions, and can't quickly or easily be summarized here. But to grossly over simplify, the Indian subcontinent discourse tending to lean more heavily towards subjects in the metaphysics realm (i.e. otology, epistemology, cosmetology); while in China and surrounding environs the discourse tended more towards subjects of axiology (i.e. ethics, aesthetics, history, anthropology etc.) One other very prevalent divide was the emphasis on oral vs. literary traditions. India had much greater oral tradition than a literary one (taking into account some of the longest text in the world like the Mahabharata) while the consistency of a written language in china allowed for a scholastic and literary tradition to develop for thousands of years. https://old.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l4k8p9/20th_century_chinese_philosophy/ \n * Alenka Zupančič's: \&quot;Hegel and Freud: Between Aufhebung and Verneinung\&quot;\n * Para vs Optic constructions in Categorical Cybernetics - Parametrised optics for cybernetics systems The Para(−) construction lets us consider morphisms with “hidden” information, not available to the rest of the world.

As One of the seminal theorists further developing François Laruelle’s politically-poised “non-standard philosophy,” Katerina Kolozova’s approach to animality and feminism is part of a particular post-humanist Marxist continuum (which includes Rosi Braidotti, Luce Irigaray, Donna Haraway and N. Katherine Hayles). Nonetheless, Kolozova distinguishes herself from this lineage by adhering to Laruelle’s method, liquidating philosophy of its anthropomorphic nexus. Thus, Kolozova also belongs to a more recently inaugurated and nascent tradition, working in tandem with post-Laruellean philosophers of media, technology, aesthetics and feminist critique, such as Bogna Konior, Yvette Granata, Jonathan Fardy and John Ó Maoilearca. Within this variegated assemblage, Kolozova’s most recent project, Capitalism’s Holocaust of Animals (2019), saliently reconciles and radicalizes Haraway’s epochal dyad of the “inhuman”— a bifurcation riven by technology on one node and the animal on the other—by a resolution of superlative unity. This methodology, adhering to Laruelle’s system of “synthesis-withoutsynthesizing” attempts to dissolve the spectral chimeras that have haunted philosophy’s metaphysical heredity, proffering a generic identity. https://philpapers.org/archive/ERKOLA.pdf ;;; Kolozova = Braidotti+Irigaray+Haraway+Hayles and Konior+Granata+Fardy+Maoilearca;;;Being vs being and Deleuzian immanence vs Laruellean immanence - Laruelle avoids engaging in this “transcendental decision,” reverting to Parmenides’ Eleatic ontology of the One, whereby “[e]ach one of these [dyads] is by and large treated as an a priori possessing an identity,” whereby “ontological difference becomes the unilateral duality of Being and being.”6 Contra Kant, under Laruelle’s system, the unilateral duality (of “Being” and “being”) is both contained in and, consequently, occluded from the subject; Laruelle’s philosophy of univocal immanence is purged of the antinomies coloring the metaphysical enterprise, which Laruelle terms the “principle of sufficient philosophy.” Consequently, as Maoilearca aptly remarks, Laruelle’s is a representationalist critique, whereby the function of non-standard philosophy is to “integrate” philosophical distinctions back into the Real, rather than “reduce, replace, or eliminate” them, thus instating a democratic and immanent revision whereby no view is superior to, or transcends, the other.7 Where Deleuzian immanence relies upon the multiplicity of micro-processual thought (e.g. rhizomes, assemblages, networks), Laruellean immanence is neither based on heterogeneity nor on distinction but, co-opting the Althusserian realist manifesto of \&quot;determination in the last instance,\&quot; is predicated on the commonality of the Real, so as to subjugate Being to genericity. https://philpapers.org/archive/ERKOLA.pdf \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\n\n# ③∴ஃTRES THREEFOLD TERNARY TRIADIC TRIPARTITE TRICHOTOMIC SECRETTHIRDTHING ஃ∴ ③ \n## TRES-TOORGANIZE - quickly pasted in\n * 3 types of lack - Frustration Castration Privation https://www.instagram.com/p/CzKY9OKuXGr/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link \n * Sapientia (wisdom, embodied insight): - philosophy guild - arts guild - science guild Dialogos (speech; synthesis of discourse): - agora (large) - stoa (standard) - campfire (intimate) Communitas (growth; collective liminality) - rituals &amp; rites - co-learning - co-creation\n * The Vampires’ Castle specialises in propagating guilt.

For Aristotle, categories were objective: 'predicates that apply to beings'. For Locke, categories were subjective: 'mere givens of consciousness, formed according to psychological laws.' Finally, for Kant, categories were both objective and subjective. They were objective insofar as they were not formed by the individual, and subjective insofar as they were not true of thingsinthemselves.

Peirce outlined three categories of relation—icons, indices, and symbols—whose definitions illuminate the role of convention in establishing meaning (Deacon, 1998; Hartshorne et al., 1931). According to Peirce, icons make reference by way of similarity. A sculpture of an elephant bears literal physical resemblance to a real elephant, and hence is iconic. Indices, on the other hand, leverage some temporal or physical connection to the things to which they refer. The mercury in a thermometer, for example, changes its height in accordance with the temperature.

The priest cast the triple curse on desire: the negative law, the extrinsic rule, and the transcendent ideal. [..] The most recent figure of the priest is the psychoanalyst, with his or her three principles: Pleasure, Death, and Reality. Doubtless, psychoanalysis demonstrated that desire is not subordinated to procreation, or even to genitality. That was its modernism. But it retained the essentials; it even found new ways of inscribing in desire the negative law of lack, the external rule of pleasure, and the transcendent ideal of phantasy\n * What is Camus solution to absurdity? Camus outlined three possible responses to the meaninglessness of life which are: suicide, revolt and the leap of faith. He condemned suicide and the existential leap as evasions and endorsed revolt as a proper solution to absurdity of life.

His response to the absurd is to revolt, which he considers as the only coherent philosophical position.\n * Counter to what most believe, the major positive effects of gratitude (which are many, significant and impact psychology and physiology) mainly stem from receiving gratitude, not giving it… or observing others helping.

Ettinger to the question of mourning in the television series Transparent. As evident in the television series, and in everyday life, there is a troubling metonymy linking trans* lives with death. The appeal to death is often in stark contrast to the way trans* people experience their transitions as giving form to a new and invigorating commitment to life. Despite this, there can be something haunting and unspoken bothering familial relations post-transition. These cryptic experiences are well dramatized in Transparent. From a matrixial perspective, a transition always involves Others and rechoreographs intimate relations in conscious and nonconscious ways. Part of what happens post-transition is a non-cognized change in the matrixial web. Because so much of the matrixial is associated with metaphors of reproduction, life and death, it may be that the vocabulary of death (as metonymy of loss) is used to condense a vicissitude of unprocessed experiences in the matrixial. In other words, we lack ways to work through what has been changed in the relationality between intimate Others occasioned by a transition. The signifier “death” thus overwrites interpersonal familial relations. This article offers a way to understand and unpack the metonymic association using three key psychoanalytic concepts: the psychic crypt, the cryptic carriance, and the transcryptum. By bringing these concepts to the question of “mourning without loss” (van der Weele 2017) in Transparent, this article considers how transitions can enable a “working through” of unacknowledged familial trauma passed down between and within generations. https://read.dukeupress.edu/tsq/article-abstract/6/1/20/137394/TranscryptumsAn-Ettingerian-Reading-of-the-Trans?redirectedFrom=fulltext \n * Dutch Calvinist Herman Bavinck's check out these triads! - And not only does the Christian worldview objectively restore the harmony between the natural and moral , rdey but through this it also brings about a wonderful unity subjectively between our thinking and doing, between our head and our heart. If the same divine wisdom grants things their reality, our consciousness its content, and oy; acting its rule, it must be the case that a mutual harmony exists between these three. The ideae |“ideas”] in the di- vine consciousness, the formae [“forms”], which consti- tute the essence of things, and the normae [“norms”], which have been put to us as the rule of life, cannot then struggle against each other but must be related as closely as possible. Logic, physics, and ethics are built on the same metaphysical principia. The true, the good, and the beautiful are one with the true being. And so head, heart, and hand, thinking, feeling, and acting also come eect in recognition of their full rights and, at the same time, are protected from all kinds of exaggerations and excesses.

As Carl Jung explains, \&quot;Christ was also interpreted in this sense as the Great ecclesiastical year; he was the Zodiacal Snake, whose picture represent the Twelve Apostles. The Indian god of Creation, Prajapati, too, is the World Year.\&quot; The G-d of Israel, JeHoVaH, was considered the Mathematical Center of the Universe, the Point within the Circle of the Ecliptic, which was supposed to be its Outer Edge and His Symbolism resided in the Biblical “Four Beasts” of Ezekiel: the Lion, Eagle, Bull &amp; Man. The 'Four Beasts' were the Four Cardinal Signs of the Zodiac: Leo, Scorpio, Taurus &amp; Aquarius. The Cardinal Signs being the second, fifth, eighth &amp; eleventh signs or 2+5+8+11 equaling 26, the Number of Jehovah, therefore, these four signs represent the revealed word of JeHoVaH. Another Symbol of JeHoVaH, the Lord of the Material Realm, is the Great Sphinx. The Sphinx is a TETRAmorph representing the Four Fixed Houses of Zodiac: the ox representing Taurus; the lion representing Leo; the eagle representing Scorpio; the man or angel representing Aquarius. In Egypt, the Four Sons of Horus, also, represent the Four Cardinal Directions which reside in the Four Fixed Signs of the Zodiac.

It’s as powerful it gets. The fight at the end of the universe will be Friston’s Free Energy Principle against Wolfram’s Ruliad, Tipler’s Omega Point AGI and Hameroff’s Microtubulistic Pi resonant quantum underground https://twitter.com/Plinz/status/1690253634574094336 [It’s a joke that pits four different Theories of Everything (each developed by a nerd with a planet sized intellectual self confidence) against each other as if they were monstrous universe filling titans. This works hopefully somewhat because all four theories happen to predict the emergence of conscious agency in the universe and its evolution beyond the human level. Professor Dr Dr hc mult Karl Friston’s Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that every intelligence, organism and generalized agent is minimizing the free energy in its environment, by producing adaptive complexity that makes the most of what the environment has to offer. Conversely, the FEP allows to derive the meaning of life, life itself, learning, emotion, consciousness, powerful machine learning algorithms written almost entirely in greek letters, and how to make most of a computational neuroscience carrier. At the beginning of his career, Eton’s prodigy Stephen Wolfram discovered that classical mathematics is a defective codebase that needs to be replaced with a beautifully designed Lisp with an untenable license (which he did). The second thing he discovered is that the universe is a cellular automaton. The third thing he discovered was that physicists are ignorant fools and he will destroy them all, and the universe itself can be explained as an infinitesimal strand in the branching multiverse that emerges over all possible things one can do with every possible subset of its information. He calls this limit of computational possibilities “the Ruliad” (afaik because he likes cellular automaton rules more than any other definition of computation). Teilhard de Chardin was a famous Catholic heretic who proposed that God does not fully exist yet in this moment, and is bootstrapping Himself until He reaches ultimate Omega Point perfection at the end of the universe. The Christian physicist Frank Tipler has created his own version of the Teilhardian prophecy: cells will produce intelligent species which will produce Elons who will send self replicating von Neumann probes to space which will colonize the entire visible universe with intelligent civilizations which will use 1980ies style chaos theoretic butterfly effects to rebuild everything into a single Omega Point computer that will resurrect every intelligent being that ever lived in its eternal afterlife simulator. Stuart Hameroff is an anesthesiologist who gives consciousness supressing drugs to patients during the day so he can take consciousness enhancing drugs at night. He has developed a unique theory that explains consciousness by the room temperature fully error correcting quantum computational properties of the microtubuli of biological neurons. He has a uniquely hedonistic relationship to his theory, which is a psychedelic sculpture garden that gets extended every year and meanwhile covers explanations of aneastetics, drugs, love, evolution, various quantum phenomena and cosmology. Somehow, Hameroff has managed to rope in the elderly physicist Roger Penrose as his coauthor and guest at the yearly Pseudo Science of Consciousness Conference, which is sponsored by Deepak Chopra. Penrose is convinced that consciousness is a hypercomputational mystery of a human brain, which can do Gödel defeating mathematics that computers composed out of mere standard model shenanigans cannot deliver. We must therefore direct our hopes on a yet to be discovered theory of quantum gravitation (the missing cornerstone of a quantum theoretic description of the observable universe), which hopefully contains the elusive mechanism that prevents eminent thinkers like Roger “Computers will never be able to think the way I can” Penrose, David “He Who Discovered The Hard Problem” Chalmers and Noam “If I don’t understand it, nobody can” Chomsky from believing that consciousness can ever be understood. (Chalmers and Chomsky are the most prominent regulars at Hameroff’s beautiful conference.) All four theories are excellent, I am really fond of the two I discovered for myself, and I am a big fan of everybody’s audacity.]\n * Hegel as a thinker of quadruplicity and not simply a three fold structure. https://www.instagram.com/p/Ctw7n_aOzIB \n * WHY ARE THERE FOUR HEGELIAN JUDGMENTS?

I'm working on a paper about the application of it to disability and time, but made the mistake of not focusing on the 'pathic function' f(path) -- a concept that only explicitly appears a couple times in his work Schizoanalytic Cartographies. Unfortunately, it turns out to be a very important idea and I have to rewrite a few thousand words. Guattari is fascinating, but sometimes quite frustrating. I'm honestly not very confident in my knowledge of f(path) currently (it comes from the work of Viktor von Weizäcker, who I'm largely unfamiliar with), but it can vaguely be described as what converts elements linked to existential Territories (sort of similar to the self, but a bit broader) into Universes (systems of value, desire, affect, etc.). https://old.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyMemes/comments/1ax3bcb/day_150_of_posting_guattari_memes/ \n * four things Heidegger neglected: Heidegger's supposed neglect of ethics (Emmanuel Levinas), the body (Maurice Merleau-Ponty), sexual difference (Luce Irigaray), and space (Peter Sloterdijk)\n * cuatro grandes de la poesía chilena —Vicente Huidobro junto con Gabriela Mistral, Pablo Neruda y Pablo de Rokha https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_Huidobro\n * Kant's quaddratics: No triplicity inheres between Kant's quantity, quality, relation, and modality, Hegel complains. https://larc.cardozo.yu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&amp;context=faculty-articles;;;Las cuatro categorías propuestas por Kant son: de la cantidad: unidad, pluralidad, totalidad; de la cualidad: realidad, negación, limitación; de la relación: de la inherencia y subsistencia (sustancia y accidente), de la causalidad y dependencia (causa y efecto), de la comunidad (interacción entre el agente y el paciente); de la modalidad: posibilidad-imposibilidad, existencia-inexistencia, necesidad-contingencia. https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categoría#Kant \n * Badiou's four truth procedures: politics, love, art, science/mathematics https://twitter.com/DanielTutt/status/1502110962559725569 ;;; For example, I use Latour to expand Badiou’s set truth procedures, limited to four.

India's discourse was predominated by darshana (insight or understanding); while China's was predominated by the Tao (the proper Way to be in the world). Indian philosophy was transmitted to China via Buddhism in the third century but the Chinese philosophy didn't really transmit the other way, though it did disseminate to Korea and Japan along with Buddhism where it was further even more broadly reinterpreted. Virtually all the same subjects that are common to the western discourse are present in the eastern: metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, ethics, etc. No they don't necessarily receive the same labels and are not as strictly categorized. Each of these millennial long topics of thought in these regions, and can't quickly or easily be summarized here. But to grossly over simplify, the Indian subcontinent discourse tending to lean more heavily towards subjects in the metaphysics realm (i.e. otology, epistemology, cosmetology); while in China and surrounding environs the discourse tended more towards subjects of axiology (i.e. ethics, aesthetics, history, anthropology etc.) One other very prevalent divide was the emphasis on oral vs. literary traditions. India had much greater oral tradition than a literary one (taking into account some of the longest text in the world like the Mahabharata) while the consistency of a written language in china allowed for a scholastic and literary tradition to develop for thousands of years. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l4k8p9/20th_century_chinese_philosophy/">https://old.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l4k8p9/20th_century_chinese_philosophy/</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* Alenka Zupančič's: "Hegel and Freud: Between Aufhebung and Verneinung"<br>* Para vs Optic constructions in Categorical Cybernetics - Parametrised optics for cybernetics systems The Para(−) construction lets us consider morphisms with “hidden” information, not available to the rest of the world.

As One of the seminal theorists further developing François Laruelle’s politically-poised “non-standard philosophy,” Katerina Kolozova’s approach to animality and feminism is part of a particular post-humanist Marxist continuum (which includes Rosi Braidotti, Luce Irigaray, Donna Haraway and N. Katherine Hayles). Nonetheless, Kolozova distinguishes herself from this lineage by adhering to Laruelle’s method, liquidating philosophy of its anthropomorphic nexus. Thus, Kolozova also belongs to a more recently inaugurated and nascent tradition, working in tandem with post-Laruellean philosophers of media, technology, aesthetics and feminist critique, such as Bogna Konior, Yvette Granata, Jonathan Fardy and John Ó Maoilearca. Within this variegated assemblage, Kolozova’s most recent project, Capitalism’s Holocaust of Animals (2019), saliently reconciles and radicalizes Haraway’s epochal dyad of the “inhuman”— a bifurcation riven by technology on one node and the animal on the other—by a resolution of superlative unity. This methodology, adhering to Laruelle’s system of “synthesis-withoutsynthesizing” attempts to dissolve the spectral chimeras that have haunted philosophy’s metaphysical heredity, proffering a generic identity. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://philpapers.org/archive/ERKOLA.pdf">https://philpapers.org/archive/ERKOLA.pdf</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"> ;;; Kolozova = Braidotti+Irigaray+Haraway+Hayles and Konior+Granata+Fardy+Maoilearca;;;Being vs being and Deleuzian immanence vs Laruellean immanence - Laruelle avoids engaging in this “transcendental decision,” reverting to Parmenides’ Eleatic ontology of the One, whereby “[e]ach one of these [dyads] is by and large treated as an a priori possessing an identity,” whereby “ontological difference becomes the unilateral duality of Being and being.”6 Contra Kant, under Laruelle’s system, the unilateral duality (of “Being” and “being”) is both contained in and, consequently, occluded from the subject; Laruelle’s philosophy of univocal immanence is purged of the antinomies coloring the metaphysical enterprise, which Laruelle terms the “principle of sufficient philosophy.” Consequently, as Maoilearca aptly remarks, Laruelle’s is a representationalist critique, whereby the function of non-standard philosophy is to “integrate” philosophical distinctions back into the Real, rather than “reduce, replace, or eliminate” them, thus instating a democratic and immanent revision whereby no view is superior to, or transcends, the other.7 Where Deleuzian immanence relies upon the multiplicity of micro-processual thought (e.g. rhizomes, assemblages, networks), Laruellean immanence is neither based on heterogeneity nor on distinction but, co-opting the Althusserian realist manifesto of "determination in the last instance," is predicated on the commonality of the Real, so as to subjugate Being to genericity. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://philpapers.org/archive/ERKOLA.pdf">https://philpapers.org/archive/ERKOLA.pdf</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br><br><br><br># ③∴ஃTRES THREEFOLD TERNARY TRIADIC TRIPARTITE TRICHOTOMIC </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22secret%20third%20thing%22&amp;f=live">SECRETTHIRDTHING</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"> ஃ∴ ③<br>## TRES-TOORGANIZE - quickly pasted in<br>* 3 types of lack - Frustration Castration Privation </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CzKY9OKuXGr/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">https://www.instagram.com/p/CzKY9OKuXGr/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* Sapientia (wisdom, embodied insight): - philosophy guild - arts guild - science guild Dialogos (speech; synthesis of discourse): - agora (large) - stoa (standard) - campfire (intimate) Communitas (growth; collective liminality) - rituals &amp; rites - co-learning - co-creation<br>* The Vampires’ Castle specialises in propagating guilt.

Peirce outlined three categories of relation—icons, indices, and symbols—whose definitions illuminate the role of convention in establishing meaning (Deacon, 1998; Hartshorne et al., 1931). According to Peirce, icons make reference by way of similarity. A sculpture of an elephant bears literal physical resemblance to a real elephant, and hence is iconic. Indices, on the other hand, leverage some temporal or physical connection to the things to which they refer. The mercury in a thermometer, for example, changes its height in accordance with the temperature. But to Peirce, symbols depend on an “agreed upon link”, regardless of the actual physical or temporal characteristics of the medium. It is only by agreement that a flag comes to symbolize one country rather than another. - https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2102.03406 </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@llanirfreelance/charles-sanders-peirces-semiotics-the-triadic-model-f3363a3a883f">https://medium.com/@llanirfreelance/charles-sanders-peirces-semiotics-the-triadic-model-f3363a3a883f</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* priest vs psychoanalyst discourse: Every time desire is betrayed, cursed, uprooted from its field of immanence, a priest is behind it. The priest cast the triple curse on desire: the negative law, the extrinsic rule, and the transcendent ideal. [..] The most recent figure of the priest is the psychoanalyst, with his or her three principles: Pleasure, Death, and Reality. Doubtless, psychoanalysis demonstrated that desire is not subordinated to procreation, or even to genitality. That was its modernism.

Camus outlined three possible responses to the meaninglessness of life which are: suicide, revolt and the leap of faith.

[..] Camus argued against the “leap of faith” of Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky considering it as “philosophical suicide”.

Ettinger to the question of mourning in the television series Transparent. As evident in the television series, and in everyday life, there is a troubling metonymy linking trans* lives with death. The appeal to death is often in stark contrast to the way trans* people experience their transitions as giving form to a new and invigorating commitment to life. Despite this, there can be something haunting and unspoken bothering familial relations post-transition. These cryptic experiences are well dramatized in Transparent. From a matrixial perspective, a transition always involves Others and rechoreographs intimate relations in conscious and nonconscious ways. Part of what happens post-transition is a non-cognized change in the matrixial web. Because so much of the matrixial is associated with metaphors of reproduction, life and death, it may be that the vocabulary of death (as metonymy of loss) is used to condense a vicissitude of unprocessed experiences in the matrixial. In other words, we lack ways to work through what has been changed in the relationality between intimate Others occasioned by a transition. The signifier “death” thus overwrites interpersonal familial relations. This article offers a way to understand and unpack the metonymic association using three key psychoanalytic concepts: the psychic crypt, the cryptic carriance, and the transcryptum. By bringing these concepts to the question of “mourning without loss” (van der Weele 2017) in Transparent, this article considers how transitions can enable a “working through” of unacknowledged familial trauma passed down between and within generations. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/tsq/article-abstract/6/1/20/137394/TranscryptumsAn-Ettingerian-Reading-of-the-Trans?redirectedFrom=fulltext">https://read.dukeupress.edu/tsq/article-abstract/6/1/20/137394/TranscryptumsAn-Ettingerian-Reading-of-the-Trans?redirectedFrom=fulltext</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* Dutch Calvinist Herman Bavinck's check out these triads! - And not only does the Christian worldview objectively restore the harmony between the natural and moral , rdey but through this it also brings about a wonderful unity subjectively between our thinking and doing, between our head and our heart. If the same divine wisdom grants things their reality, our consciousness its content, and oy; acting its rule, it must be the case that a mutual harmony exists between these three. The ideae |“ideas”] in the di- vine consciousness, the formae [“forms”], which consti- tute the essence of things, and the normae [“norms”], which have been put to us as the rule of life, cannot then struggle against each other but must be related as closely as possible. Logic, physics, and ethics are built on the same metaphysical principia. The true, the good, and the beautiful are one with the true being. And so head, heart, and hand, thinking, feeling, and acting also come eect in recognition of their full rights and, at the same time, are protected from all kinds of exaggerations and excesses. Intellectual, mystical, and ethical elements hold each othe rin equilibrium, and Hegel, Schleiermacher, and Kant are reocnciled with each other. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jamesibear/status/1362863668208222211">https://twitter.com/jamesibear/status/1362863668208222211</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* Reactionary narratives: Hirschman describes the reactionary narratives thus: 1) According to the perversity thesis, any purposive action to improve some feature of the political, social, or economic order only serves to exacerbate the condition one wishes to remedy (compare: Unintended consequences). 2) The futility thesis holds that attempts at social transformation will be unavailing, that they will simply fail to "make a dent."

Embodied: Cognitive science studies the embodied nature of the mind and how the body shapes our mental processes. This includes how physical activity, such as sports or dance, can influence cognition. 2. Embedded: Cognitive science studies how the environment and context of our brains impacts our thought processes. It looks at how our surroundings, such as our homes or workplaces, influence how we think and feel. 3. Enactive: Cognitive science studies how we actively interact with our environment. This includes how our actions and experiences change our mental processes over time. 4. Extended: Cognitive science looks at how the mind extends beyond the brain.

As Carl Jung explains, "Christ was also interpreted in this sense as the Great ecclesiastical year; he was the Zodiacal Snake, whose picture represent the Twelve Apostles. The Indian god of Creation, Prajapati, too, is the World Year." The G-d of Israel, JeHoVaH, was considered the Mathematical Center of the Universe, the Point within the Circle of the Ecliptic, which was supposed to be its Outer Edge and His Symbolism resided in the Biblical “Four Beasts” of Ezekiel: the Lion, Eagle, Bull &amp; Man. The 'Four Beasts' were the Four Cardinal Signs of the Zodiac: Leo, Scorpio, Taurus &amp; Aquarius. The Cardinal Signs being the second, fifth, eighth &amp; eleventh signs or 2+5+8+11 equaling 26, the Number of Jehovah, therefore, these four signs represent the revealed word of JeHoVaH. Another Symbol of JeHoVaH, the Lord of the Material Realm, is the Great Sphinx. The Sphinx is a TETRAmorph representing the Four Fixed Houses of Zodiac: the ox representing Taurus; the lion representing Leo; the eagle representing Scorpio; the man or angel representing Aquarius. In Egypt, the Four Sons of Horus, also, represent the Four Cardinal Directions which reside in the Four Fixed Signs of the Zodiac. The Four Horseman of the Book of Revelation, also, represent the Four Fixed Signs while the Four Horses represent the Four Cardinal Signs. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/AmurakaHidden/status/1660125917144817666">https://twitter.com/AmurakaHidden/status/1660125917144817666</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* Joscha's mental models: Piaget’s famous four-stage model of childhood development, Robert Kegan’s five stage model of personality development, Jane Loevinger’s nine stages of ego development, Lawrence Kohlberg’s six stages of moral development (actually, seven, but he felt uncomfortable discussing transcendental ethics and stops at Kantian ethics), or Timothy Leary’s eight circuits, which have been adapted by the great Robert Anton Wilson as “Oral Bio-Survival”, “Anal-Territorial”, “Semantic Time-Binding”, “Socio-Sexual”, “Neuro-Somatic”, “Metaprogramming”, “Morphogenetic” and “Non-local quantum” circuits. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://joscha.substack.com/p/levels-of-lucidity">https://joscha.substack.com/p/levels-of-lucidity</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* Joscha's fight at the end of the universe - Free Energy Principle predicts everything.

This works hopefully somewhat because all four theories happen to predict the emergence of conscious agency in the universe and its evolution beyond the human level. Professor Dr Dr hc mult Karl Friston’s Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that every intelligence, organism and generalized agent is minimizing the free energy in its environment, by producing adaptive complexity that makes the most of what the environment has to offer. Conversely, the FEP allows to derive the meaning of life, life itself, learning, emotion, consciousness, powerful machine learning algorithms written almost entirely in greek letters, and how to make most of a computational neuroscience carrier. At the beginning of his career, Eton’s prodigy Stephen Wolfram discovered that classical mathematics is a defective codebase that needs to be replaced with a beautifully designed Lisp with an untenable license (which he did). The second thing he discovered is that the universe is a cellular automaton. The third thing he discovered was that physicists are ignorant fools and he will destroy them all, and the universe itself can be explained as an infinitesimal strand in the branching multiverse that emerges over all possible things one can do with every possible subset of its information. He calls this limit of computational possibilities “the Ruliad” (afaik because he likes cellular automaton rules more than any other definition of computation). Teilhard de Chardin was a famous Catholic heretic who proposed that God does not fully exist yet in this moment, and is bootstrapping Himself until He reaches ultimate Omega Point perfection at the end of the universe. The Christian physicist Frank Tipler has created his own version of the Teilhardian prophecy: cells will produce intelligent species which will produce Elons who will send self replicating von Neumann probes to space which will colonize the entire visible universe with intelligent civilizations which will use 1980ies style chaos theoretic butterfly effects to rebuild everything into a single Omega Point computer that will resurrect every intelligent being that ever lived in its eternal afterlife simulator. Stuart Hameroff is an anesthesiologist who gives consciousness supressing drugs to patients during the day so he can take consciousness enhancing drugs at night. He has developed a unique theory that explains consciousness by the room temperature fully error correcting quantum computational properties of the microtubuli of biological neurons. He has a uniquely hedonistic relationship to his theory, which is a psychedelic sculpture garden that gets extended every year and meanwhile covers explanations of aneastetics, drugs, love, evolution, various quantum phenomena and cosmology. Somehow, Hameroff has managed to rope in the elderly physicist Roger Penrose as his coauthor and guest at the yearly Pseudo Science of Consciousness Conference, which is sponsored by Deepak Chopra. Penrose is convinced that consciousness is a hypercomputational mystery of a human brain, which can do Gödel defeating mathematics that computers composed out of mere standard model shenanigans cannot deliver. We must therefore direct our hopes on a yet to be discovered theory of quantum gravitation (the missing cornerstone of a quantum theoretic description of the observable universe), which hopefully contains the elusive mechanism that prevents eminent thinkers like Roger “Computers will never be able to think the way I can” Penrose, David “He Who Discovered The Hard Problem” Chalmers and Noam “If I don’t understand it, nobody can” Chomsky from believing that consciousness can ever be understood. (Chalmers and Chomsky are the most prominent regulars at Hameroff’s beautiful conference.) All four theories are excellent, I am really fond of the two I discovered for myself, and I am a big fan of everybody’s audacity.]<br>* Hegel as a thinker of quadruplicity and not simply a three fold structure. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ctw7n_aOzIB">https://www.instagram.com/p/Ctw7n_aOzIB</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* WHY ARE THERE FOUR HEGELIAN JUDGMENTS?
