<li>Spinal Catastrophism.pdf - &quot;Bataille locates in man’s spinal realignment merely a more refined lasciviousness—a more violent voluptuousness. To wit, he pinpoints ‘Two Terrestrial Axes’: the ‘vertical’, which ‘prolongs the radius of the terrestrial sphere’ as axis of libertine escape, lorded by ocean tides and plants (which ‘flee’ the earth to sacrifice themselves ‘endlessly’ to the Sun’s downward onslaught); and the ‘horizontal’, domicile to beasts and ‘analogous to the turning of the earth’. ‘Only human beings’, Bataille notes, ‘tearing themselves away from peaceful animal horizontality’, have ‘succeeded in appropriating the vegetal erection’, surrendering themselves to exquisite upwards collapse towards outer space’s solar enormities and fluxions.&quot; Kant had linked the terrestrial-spinal axis to self-orienting rationality, but for Bataille the excremental effluence of the simian anus is merely rerouted upward—‘blossoming with the most delirious richness of forms’—in the ostentatious bulbing of the sapient cranium, a most exotic and wanton flower. The surging gradient of expenditure migrates from digestive-horizontal slope to the more intensified zenith-realm of intelligences. And yet, as Bataille notes, this upward-thrusting ‘liberation of man’ is somewhat end-stopped or bottlenecked by the skull’s right angle. Like the swell of a kinked hose, the perpendicular brain-cap is a ballooning instability. Along with Reich and Ferenczi, Bataille notes that in laughter, coitus, and torment this blockage in the solar-spinal surge is relieved: we assume free-flowing continuity with celestial potlatch. He wrote that ‘human life is bestially concentrated in the mouth’.</li>

India's discourse was predominated by darshana (insight or understanding); while China's was predominated by the Tao (the proper Way to be in the world). Indian philosophy was transmitted to China via Buddhism in the third century but the Chinese philosophy didn't really transmit the other way, though it did disseminate to Korea and Japan along with Buddhism where it was further even more broadly reinterpreted. Virtually all the same subjects that are common to the western discourse are present in the eastern: metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, ethics, etc. No they don't necessarily receive the same labels and are not as strictly categorized. Each of these millennial long topics of thought in these regions, and can't quickly or easily be summarized here. But to grossly over simplify, the Indian subcontinent discourse tending to lean more heavily towards subjects in the metaphysics realm (i.e. otology, epistemology, cosmetology); while in China and surrounding environs the discourse tended more towards subjects of axiology (i.e. ethics, aesthetics, history, anthropology etc.) One other very prevalent divide was the emphasis on oral vs. literary traditions. India had much greater oral tradition than a literary one (taking into account some of the longest text in the world like the Mahabharata) while the consistency of a written language in china allowed for a scholastic and literary tradition to develop for thousands of years. https://old.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l4k8p9/20th_century_chinese_philosophy/ \n * Alenka Zupančič's: \&quot;Hegel and Freud: Between Aufhebung and Verneinung\&quot;\n * Para vs Optic constructions in Categorical Cybernetics - Parametrised optics for cybernetics systems The Para(−) construction lets us consider morphisms with “hidden” information, not available to the rest of the world.

Applying the former to the latter results in a sophisticated construction which we unpack in this section.\n * realism/correlationism dyad - Zizek on Meillassoux \&quot;Correlationism and Its Discontents\&quot; https://itself.blog/2012/12/20/zizek-on-meillassoux/ \n * Donna Haraway’s epochal dyad of the “inhuman”— a bifurcation riven by technology on one node and the animal on the other. As One of the seminal theorists further developing François Laruelle’s politically-poised “non-standard philosophy,” Katerina Kolozova’s approach to animality and feminism is part of a particular post-humanist Marxist continuum (which includes Rosi Braidotti, Luce Irigaray, Donna Haraway and N. Katherine Hayles). Nonetheless, Kolozova distinguishes herself from this lineage by adhering to Laruelle’s method, liquidating philosophy of its anthropomorphic nexus. Thus, Kolozova also belongs to a more recently inaugurated and nascent tradition, working in tandem with post-Laruellean philosophers of media, technology, aesthetics and feminist critique, such as Bogna Konior, Yvette Granata, Jonathan Fardy and John Ó Maoilearca. Within this variegated assemblage, Kolozova’s most recent project, Capitalism’s Holocaust of Animals (2019), saliently reconciles and radicalizes Haraway’s epochal dyad of the “inhuman”— a bifurcation riven by technology on one node and the animal on the other—by a resolution of superlative unity. This methodology, adhering to Laruelle’s system of “synthesis-withoutsynthesizing” attempts to dissolve the spectral chimeras that have haunted philosophy’s metaphysical heredity, proffering a generic identity. https://philpapers.org/archive/ERKOLA.pdf ;;; Kolozova = Braidotti+Irigaray+Haraway+Hayles and Konior+Granata+Fardy+Maoilearca;;;Being vs being and Deleuzian immanence vs Laruellean immanence - Laruelle avoids engaging in this “transcendental decision,” reverting to Parmenides’ Eleatic ontology of the One, whereby “[e]ach one of these [dyads] is by and large treated as an a priori possessing an identity,” whereby “ontological difference becomes the unilateral duality of Being and being.”6 Contra Kant, under Laruelle’s system, the unilateral duality (of “Being” and “being”) is both contained in and, consequently, occluded from the subject; Laruelle’s philosophy of univocal immanence is purged of the antinomies coloring the metaphysical enterprise, which Laruelle terms the “principle of sufficient philosophy.” Consequently, as Maoilearca aptly remarks, Laruelle’s is a representationalist critique, whereby the function of non-standard philosophy is to “integrate” philosophical distinctions back into the Real, rather than “reduce, replace, or eliminate” them, thus instating a democratic and immanent revision whereby no view is superior to, or transcends, the other.7 Where Deleuzian immanence relies upon the multiplicity of micro-processual thought (e.g. rhizomes, assemblages, networks), Laruellean immanence is neither based on heterogeneity nor on distinction but, co-opting the Althusserian realist manifesto of \&quot;determination in the last instance,\&quot; is predicated on the commonality of the Real, so as to subjugate Being to genericity. https://philpapers.org/archive/ERKOLA.pdf \n * Substance Metaphysics (Ontology) and Aesthetics of Quality (Theo-Ontology) - Two Tetralogies - https://www.patreon.com/posts/two-tetralogies-69017313 \n * Māhiyya (Whatness) vs Haqīqa (Truth) - Māhiyya is part of #PronounPhilosophy \n * givens vs releases (instead of constraints vs releases) The \&quot;Introduction\&quot; of Belonging Again (Part I) suggested that the text would attempt to craft 'a theory of the psychohistorical process,' which is why I've used the language of \&quot;givens and releases\&quot; versus \&quot;constraints and releases\&quot; like Rieff, which though similar in spirit, allows me to better connect Rieff with David Hume, the Counter-Enlightenment, Hegel, Hannah Arendt, and others, a move made throughout O.G. Rose.¹ With the language of \&quot;givens,\&quot; it becomes easier to connect Belonging Again with The True Isn't the Rational and my work on Hegel, all of which I think is needed to write that \&quot;theory of the psychohistorical process.\&quot; To point ahead, I will end by meditating on Freud's disagreement with Jung, as described by Philip Rieff himself, which for me helps connect Freud and Hegel (an intellectual undertaking pioneered by Cadell Last). With this move, we will glimpse why managing the situation described in Belonging Again will require something more Freudian and aligned with living according to paradoxical \&quot;Absolute Knowing,\&quot; as already suggested by the paper - not that this will be easy. Part II of Belonging Again will attempt to explore further what that \&quot;paradoxical living\&quot; (according to A/B versus A/A) might look like, another notion explored throughout O.G. Rose. Ultimately, this will lead us into setting the board for future works, with a focus on how a failure to address \&quot;the problem of scale\&quot; could be for us to stumble into a world of \&quot;small fascist states.\&quot; The stakes are high... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN0GFv_CyjI\n * Freud’s repeating (Wiederholen) and remembering (Erinnerung) - I will evaluate Heidegger’s tempocentrism in chapter 6, but what must be borne in mind here is that he was well aware that the future cannot be severed from the other two modalities of time. Most telling is the locution futurally having-been, an expression that insinuates the transposal of the causal order such that the past is the effect of the future rather than the future being the effect of the past, a reversal of tempo- ral causality that is resonant with similar strategies in psychoanalytic theory, especially the Freudian concept of nachträglich, rendered by Lacan as l’après coup, that is, “after the fact,”127 the deferred action that assumes the character of the future perfect tense (futur antérieur) in place of the present perfect tense. In Lacan’s own words: “What is realized in my history is neither the past definite as what was, since it is no more, nor even the perfect as what has been in what I am, but the future anterior as what I will have been, given what I am in the process of becoming.”128 According to this construal of time, the symptom does not relate primarily to an occurrence in the past but rather to an event that awaits its futural unfolding.129 Lacan thus tenders a corrective to the time-function of the logic implied by Freud’s idea of repeating (Wiederholen) and remembering (Erinnerung), according to which “the real is that which always comes back to the same place—to the place where the subject in so far as he thinks, where the res cogitans, does not meet it.”130 To remember, in its deepest assonance, is to repeat, but to repeat, as I have noted several times, means to come back to the same place where one has always never been. One cannot but be struck by the conceptual proximity of Lacan’s privileging of the future to the view of temporality prioritized by Heidegger—especially pertinent is the Heideggerian notion of the Heidegger and Kabbalah 46 “remembering expectation [erinnernde Erharren],” that is, awaiting a call of beyng (einen Zuruf des Seyns) by recollecting a hidden belonging to beyng (eine verhüllte Zugehörigkeit zum Seyn), the remembrance of what is to come as the temporalization (Zeitigung) of the “dispensation of the (hesitant) self-withholding [Fügung des Sichversagens (des zögernden)]” that “a-byssally grounds the domain of decision [gründet ab-gründigerweise den Entscheidungsbereich]”131—and I should add, the kabbalistic conception of time as the retroactive not yet, an idea that I have argued also betrays affinity with the Derridean trace.\n * Kantian Begriff vs Erkenntnis - Schelling responds in his late lectures at Berlin invoking the Kantian distinction between Begriff and Erkenntnis, concept and cognition, and so distinguishing sharply between essence and existence, between what (Was) something is and that (Daß) it exists. To explicate further he invokes medieval terminology: Here we should note that in everything that is real there are two things to be known: it is two entirely different things to know what a being is, quid sit, and that it is, quod sit. The former—the answer to the question what it is—accords me insight into the essence of the thing, or it provides that I understand the thing, that I have an understanding or a concept [Begriff] of it, or have it itself within the concept. The other insight however, that it is, does not accord me just the concept, but rather something that goes beyond just the concept, which is existence. This is a cognition [ein Erkennen] whereby it is readily clear that while Hegel and Schelling on the Path of Aristotelian Ascent 6 there can be a concept without a real cognition, it is not possible for there to be a cognition without a concept.26 Quid sit corresponds to mere concepts without reference to empirical content, to essence in the absence of existence. By contrast, quod sit corresponds to cognitions in which existence and essence necessarily combine.2\n * Zizek's Deleuze's two ontologies - Žižek reads in Deleuze’s corpus two different ontologies, one engaged with in his solo work and the other in his collaborations with Guattari. The first—the proper Lacanian position—presents the event as an effect of primordial causes, or rather, as the “irruption of the [Lacanian] Real within the domain of causality”.5 The second—the philosophically contaminated position—affirms the event as a continuous, virtual process of production that creates the discontinuous structures of the actual.6 Žižek sees Deleuze struggling between these two positions in his last book prior to meeting Guattari, The logic of sense, 7 but the publication of Anti-Oedipus marks a decisive turn away from the former position in favor of the latter—a turn that Žižek sees as largely precipitated by Guattari’s radical politics. Anti-Oedipus, in Žižek’s eyes, therefore marks a critical turn away from Lacan and is worthy of being dismissed as “arguably Deleuze’s worse book”. https://depts.washington.edu/chid/intersections_Autumn_2009/Luke_Caldwell_Schizophrenizing_Lacan.pdf \n * releases vs givens, address vs explanation - Belonging Again can be seen as the sociological implications of taking seriously that “the true isn’t the rational” and that “autonomous rationality” is impossible, for the split between “truth” and “rationality” can overlap with the distinction between “givens” and “releases,” “social support” and “individual expression,” and so on. https://ogrose.substack.com/p/the-conclusion-of-belonging-again \n * Cute Accelerationism's dyads - the hyperstitional cultures of shojo and otaku, denpa and 2D love, and the cute subworlds of aegyo and meng, moé and flatmaxxing, catboys and dogon eggs, bobbles and gummies, vore machines and partial objects, BwOs and UwUs…glomping, snuggling, smooshing and squeeeeing their way toward the event horizon of Cute, donning cat ears and popping bubbles as they go, in this untimely philosophical intensification of an omnipresent phenomenon, having surrendered to the squishiest demonic possession, like, ever, two bffs set out in search of the transcendental shape of cuteness only to realize that, even though it is all around us, we do not yet know what Cute can do. https://www.amazon.com/Cute-Accelerationism-Amy-Ireland/dp/1915103150 \n * Alex Ebert's/Fre(Q) theory's ​​Regularity (anchor) + Unknown (riffs) - anchor and riffs are needed in a structure for music, creation, etc...New quality, like Ebert was saying https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crEf80gwe9U \n * modus ponens vs modus tollens, or pro tanto vs pro toto - \&quot;One man’s modus ponens is another man’s modus tollens\&quot; or \&quot;One man's pro tanto is another man's pro toto\&quot; https://old.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1ccnqhe/tip_of_my_tongue_one_persons_the_premise_is_wrong/ \n * @hyperduality2838 9 hours ago Yes imaginary numbers are dual. Orthogonality, perpendicularity = duality. Sine is dual to cosine or dual sine -- the word co means mutual and implies duality. Real is dual to imaginary -- complex numbers are dual. Injective is dual to surjective synthesizes bijective or isomorphism -- group theory. Syntax is dual to semantics -- languages or communication. If mathematics is a language then it is dual. Lie groups are dual to Lie algebras. Vectors (contravariant) are dual to co-vectors (covariant) -- dual bases. Riemann geometry or curvature is dual -- upper indices are dual to lower indices. Positive curvature (convergence, syntropy) is dual to negative curvature (divergence, entropy) -- Gauss, Riemann geometry. Subgroups are dual to subfields -- the Galois correspondence. Elliptic curves are dual to modular forms. Categories (form, syntax, objects) are dual to sets (substance, semantics, subjects) -- Category theory. \&quot;Always two there are\&quot; -- Yoda. Poles (eigenvalues) are dual to zeros -- optimized control theory. All numbers fall within the complex plane hence all numbers are dual. The integers are self dual as they are their own conjugates. Duality creates reality! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RHSS-zMaAQ&amp;lc=UgxnyzXb6WDQrCuDoKF4AaABAg.A2hmQMBfW71A2oE_aXf1tE https://www.youtube.com/@hyperduality2838 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective_function \n * Nature/Notion - OGRose/Steiner: That in mind, today, there only seems to be Nature/Notion, and it is possible that the introduction of Notion changes how Nature unfolds (a point that suggest Rudolph Steiner)\n * Kant's de jure / de dicto: Kant’s 2nd Critique has popularised the similar (prescriptive/descriptive) distinction between de jure and de dicto.

It mobilises other modules and, from this fact, creates a pragmatic surplus value of code. That is, before then, we used to think that it only worked in the register of music, but – as soon as it effectively engaged other aesthetic or pragmatic registers – there was the appropriation [accaparement] of subjectities, although those that are objectities (objectic blocks of subjectivity, so to speak). https://old.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyMemes/comments/1cvl30m/day_152_of_posting_guattari_memes/\n * Schelling's \&quot;Naturphilosophie\&quot; vs \&quot;Philosophie der Natur\&quot;\n * dimorphism? - Less sexual dimorphism??

It's more than interpretability. This distinction is based on the paper \&quot;Explainable Machine Learning for Scientific Insights and Discoveries\&quot; by Roscher et. al. Others make a different distinction: Interpretable for \&quot;inherently interpretable\&quot; models and explainability for post-hoc methods. But I'm not a fan, for two reasons: 1) lines are blurry between the two categories, think of marginal effects for logistic regression. Or if you compute SHAP values for GAMs, they are the same as the feature effects in the GAM (with a constant shift). 2) to me the term explainability sounds like having a higher bar than interpretability. For example, permutation feature importance would be counted as an \&quot;explainability method\&quot;, but model interpretation sounds much more nuanced. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christoph-molnar_usually-i-use-interpretability-and-explainability-activity-7189649997041188867-Vvan\n* In machine learning, we often distinguish aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Aleatoric is called irreducible error because it's caused by \&quot;true\&quot; randomness, and epistemic is reducible, caused by lack of information, like model misspecification.

India's discourse was predominated by darshana (insight or understanding); while China's was predominated by the Tao (the proper Way to be in the world). Indian philosophy was transmitted to China via Buddhism in the third century but the Chinese philosophy didn't really transmit the other way, though it did disseminate to Korea and Japan along with Buddhism where it was further even more broadly reinterpreted. Virtually all the same subjects that are common to the western discourse are present in the eastern: metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, ethics, etc. No they don't necessarily receive the same labels and are not as strictly categorized. Each of these millennial long topics of thought in these regions, and can't quickly or easily be summarized here. But to grossly over simplify, the Indian subcontinent discourse tending to lean more heavily towards subjects in the metaphysics realm (i.e. otology, epistemology, cosmetology); while in China and surrounding environs the discourse tended more towards subjects of axiology (i.e. ethics, aesthetics, history, anthropology etc.) One other very prevalent divide was the emphasis on oral vs. literary traditions. India had much greater oral tradition than a literary one (taking into account some of the longest text in the world like the Mahabharata) while the consistency of a written language in china allowed for a scholastic and literary tradition to develop for thousands of years. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l4k8p9/20th_century_chinese_philosophy/">https://old.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l4k8p9/20th_century_chinese_philosophy/</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* Alenka Zupančič's: "Hegel and Freud: Between Aufhebung and Verneinung"<br>* Para vs Optic constructions in Categorical Cybernetics - Parametrised optics for cybernetics systems The Para(−) construction lets us consider morphisms with “hidden” information, not available to the rest of the world.

As One of the seminal theorists further developing François Laruelle’s politically-poised “non-standard philosophy,” Katerina Kolozova’s approach to animality and feminism is part of a particular post-humanist Marxist continuum (which includes Rosi Braidotti, Luce Irigaray, Donna Haraway and N. Katherine Hayles). Nonetheless, Kolozova distinguishes herself from this lineage by adhering to Laruelle’s method, liquidating philosophy of its anthropomorphic nexus. Thus, Kolozova also belongs to a more recently inaugurated and nascent tradition, working in tandem with post-Laruellean philosophers of media, technology, aesthetics and feminist critique, such as Bogna Konior, Yvette Granata, Jonathan Fardy and John Ó Maoilearca. Within this variegated assemblage, Kolozova’s most recent project, Capitalism’s Holocaust of Animals (2019), saliently reconciles and radicalizes Haraway’s epochal dyad of the “inhuman”— a bifurcation riven by technology on one node and the animal on the other—by a resolution of superlative unity. This methodology, adhering to Laruelle’s system of “synthesis-withoutsynthesizing” attempts to dissolve the spectral chimeras that have haunted philosophy’s metaphysical heredity, proffering a generic identity. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://philpapers.org/archive/ERKOLA.pdf">https://philpapers.org/archive/ERKOLA.pdf</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"> ;;; Kolozova = Braidotti+Irigaray+Haraway+Hayles and Konior+Granata+Fardy+Maoilearca;;;Being vs being and Deleuzian immanence vs Laruellean immanence - Laruelle avoids engaging in this “transcendental decision,” reverting to Parmenides’ Eleatic ontology of the One, whereby “[e]ach one of these [dyads] is by and large treated as an a priori possessing an identity,” whereby “ontological difference becomes the unilateral duality of Being and being.”6 Contra Kant, under Laruelle’s system, the unilateral duality (of “Being” and “being”) is both contained in and, consequently, occluded from the subject; Laruelle’s philosophy of univocal immanence is purged of the antinomies coloring the metaphysical enterprise, which Laruelle terms the “principle of sufficient philosophy.” Consequently, as Maoilearca aptly remarks, Laruelle’s is a representationalist critique, whereby the function of non-standard philosophy is to “integrate” philosophical distinctions back into the Real, rather than “reduce, replace, or eliminate” them, thus instating a democratic and immanent revision whereby no view is superior to, or transcends, the other.7 Where Deleuzian immanence relies upon the multiplicity of micro-processual thought (e.g. rhizomes, assemblages, networks), Laruellean immanence is neither based on heterogeneity nor on distinction but, co-opting the Althusserian realist manifesto of "determination in the last instance," is predicated on the commonality of the Real, so as to subjugate Being to genericity. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://philpapers.org/archive/ERKOLA.pdf">https://philpapers.org/archive/ERKOLA.pdf</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* Substance Metaphysics (Ontology) and Aesthetics of Quality (Theo-Ontology) - Two Tetralogies - </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/two-tetralogies-69017313">https://www.patreon.com/posts/two-tetralogies-69017313</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* Māhiyya (Whatness) vs Haqīqa (Truth) - Māhiyya is part of #PronounPhilosophy<br>* givens vs releases (instead of constraints vs releases) The "Introduction" of Belonging Again (Part I) suggested that the text would attempt to craft 'a theory of the psychohistorical process,' which is why I've used the language of "givens and releases" versus "constraints and releases" like Rieff, which though similar in spirit, allows me to better connect Rieff with David Hume, the Counter-Enlightenment, Hegel, Hannah Arendt, and others, a move made throughout O.G. Rose.¹ With the language of"givens," it becomes easier to connect Belonging Again with The True Isn't the Rational and my work on Hegel, all of which I think is needed to write that "theory of the psychohistorical process." To point ahead, I will end by meditating on Freud's disagreement with Jung, as described by Philip Rieff himself, which for me helps connect Freud and Hegel (an intellectual undertaking pioneered by Cadell Last). With this move, we will glimpse why managing the situation described in Belonging Again will require something more Freudian and aligned with living according to paradoxical "Absolute Knowing," as already suggested by the paper - not that this will be easy. Part II of Belonging Again will attempt to explore further what that "paradoxical living" (according to A/B versus A/A) might look like, another notion explored throughout O.G. Rose. Ultimately, this will lead us into setting the board for future works, with a focus on how a failure to address "the problem of scale" could be for us to stumble into a world of "small fascist states." The stakes are high... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN0GFv_CyjI<br>* Freud’s repeating (Wiederholen) and remembering (Erinnerung) - I will evaluate Heidegger’s tempocentrism in chapter 6, but what must be borne in mind here is that he was well aware that the future cannot be severed from the other two modalities of time. Most telling is the locution futurally having-been, an expression that insinuates the transposal of the causal order such that the past is the effect of the future rather than the future being the effect of the past, a reversal of tempo- ral causality that is resonant with similar strategies in psychoanalytic theory, especially the Freudian concept of nachträglich, rendered by Lacan as l’après coup, that is, “after the fact,”127 the deferred action that assumes the character of the future perfect tense (futur antérieur) in place of the present perfect tense. In Lacan’s own words: “What is realized in my history is neither the past definite as what was, since it is no more, nor even the perfect as what has been in what I am, but the future anterior as what I will have been, given what I am in the process of becoming.”128 According to this construal of time, the symptom does not relate primarily to an occurrence in the past but rather to an event that awaits its futural unfolding.129 Lacan thus tenders a corrective to the time-function of the logic implied by Freud’s idea of repeating (Wiederholen) and remembering (Erinnerung), according to which “the real is that which always comes back to the same place—to the place where the subject in so far as he thinks, where the res cogitans, does not meet it.”130 To remember, in its deepest assonance, is to repeat, but to repeat, as I have noted several times, means to come back to the same place where one has always never been. One cannot but be struck by the conceptual proximity of Lacan’s privileging of the future to the view of temporality prioritized by Heidegger—especially pertinent is the Heideggerian notion of the Heidegger and Kabbalah 46 “remembering expectation [erinnernde Erharren],” that is, awaiting a call of beyng (einen Zuruf des Seyns) by recollecting a hidden belonging to beyng (eine verhüllte Zugehörigkeit zum Seyn), the remembrance of what is to come as the temporalization (Zeitigung) of the “dispensation of the (hesitant) self-withholding [Fügung des Sichversagens (des zögernden)]” that “a-byssally grounds the domain of decision [gründet ab-gründigerweise den Entscheidungsbereich]”131—and I should add, the kabbalistic conception of time as the retroactive not yet, an idea that I have argued also betrays affinity with the Derridean trace.<br>* Kantian Begriff vs Erkenntnis - Schelling responds in his late lectures at Berlin invoking the Kantian distinction between Begriff and Erkenntnis, concept and cognition, and so distinguishing sharply between essence and existence, between what (Was) something is and that (Daß) it exists. To explicate further he invokes medieval terminology: Here we should note that in everything that is real there are two things to be known: it is two entirely different things to know what a being is, quid sit, and that it is, quod sit. The former—the answer to the question what it is—accords me insight into the essence of the thing, or it provides that I understand the thing, that I have an understanding or a concept [Begriff] of it, or have it itself within the concept. The other insight however, that it is, does not accord me just the concept, but rather something that goes beyond just the concept, which is existence. This is a cognition [ein Erkennen] whereby it is readily clear that while Hegel and Schelling on the Path of Aristotelian Ascent 6 there can be a concept without a real cognition, it is not possible for there to be a cognition without a concept.26 Quid sit corresponds to mere concepts without reference to empirical content, to essence in the absence of existence. By contrast, quod sit corresponds to cognitions in which existence and essence necessarily combine.2<br>* Zizek's Deleuze's two ontologies - Žižek reads in Deleuze’s corpus two different ontologies, one engaged with in his solo work and the other in his collaborations with Guattari. The first—the proper Lacanian position—presents the event as an effect of primordial causes, or rather, as the “irruption of the [Lacanian] Real within the domain of causality”.5 The second—the philosophically contaminated position—affirms the event as a continuous, virtual process of production that creates the discontinuous structures of the actual.6 Žižek sees Deleuze struggling between these two positions in his last book prior to meeting Guattari, The logic of sense, 7 but the publication of Anti-Oedipus marks a decisive turn away from the former position in favor of the latter—a turn that Žižek sees as largely precipitated by Guattari’s radical politics. Anti-Oedipus, in Žižek’s eyes, therefore marks a critical turn away from Lacan and is worthy of being dismissed as “arguably Deleuze’s worse book”. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://depts.washington.edu/chid/intersections_Autumn_2009/Luke_Caldwell_Schizophrenizing_Lacan.pdf">https://depts.washington.edu/chid/intersections_Autumn_2009/Luke_Caldwell_Schizophrenizing_Lacan.pdf</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* releases vs givens, address vs explanation - Belonging Again can be seen as the sociological implications of taking seriously that “the true isn’t the rational” and that “autonomous rationality” is impossible, for the split between “truth” and “rationality” can overlap with the distinction between “givens” and “releases,” “social support” and “individual expression,” and so on. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://ogrose.substack.com/p/the-conclusion-of-belonging-again">https://ogrose.substack.com/p/the-conclusion-of-belonging-again</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* Cute Accelerationism's dyads - the hyperstitional cultures of shojo and otaku, denpa and 2D love, and the cute subworlds of aegyo and meng, moé and flatmaxxing, catboys and dogon eggs, bobbles and gummies, vore machines and partial objects, BwOs and UwUs…glomping, snuggling, smooshing and squeeeeing their way toward the event horizon of Cute, donning cat ears and popping bubbles as they go, in this untimely philosophical intensification of an omnipresent phenomenon, having surrendered to the squishiest demonic possession, like, ever, two bffs set out in search of the transcendental shape of cuteness only to realize that, even though it is all around us, we do not yet know what Cute can do. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Cute-Accelerationism-Amy-Ireland/dp/1915103150">https://www.amazon.com/Cute-Accelerationism-Amy-Ireland/dp/1915103150</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* Alex Ebert's/Fre(Q) theory's ​​Regularity (anchor) + Unknown (riffs) - anchor and riffs are needed in a structure for music, creation, etc...New quality, like Ebert was saying </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crEf80gwe9U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crEf80gwe9U</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* modus ponens vs modus tollens, or pro tanto vs pro toto - "One man’s modus ponens is another man’s modus tollens" or "One man's pro tanto is another man's pro toto" </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1ccnqhe/tip_of_my_tongue_one_persons_the_premise_is_wrong/">https://old.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1ccnqhe/tip_of_my_tongue_one_persons_the_premise_is_wrong/</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* @hyperduality2838 9 hours ago Yes imaginary numbers are dual.

Injective is dual to surjective synthesizes bijective or isomorphism -- group theory. Syntax is dual to semantics -- languages or communication. If mathematics is a language then it is dual. Lie groups are dual to Lie algebras. Vectors (contravariant) are dual to co-vectors (covariant) -- dual bases. Riemann geometry or curvature is dual -- upper indices are dual to lower indices. Positive curvature (convergence, syntropy) is dual to negative curvature (divergence, entropy) -- Gauss, Riemann geometry. Subgroups are dual to subfields -- the Galois correspondence. Elliptic curves are dual to modular forms. Categories (form, syntax, objects) are dual to sets (substance, semantics, subjects) -- Category theory. "Always two there are" -- Yoda. Poles (eigenvalues) are dual to zeros -- optimized control theory. All numbers fall within the complex plane hence all numbers are dual. The integers are self dual as they are their own conjugates.

It's more than interpretability. This distinction is based on the paper "Explainable Machine Learning for Scientific Insights and Discoveries" by Roscher et. al. Others make a different distinction: Interpretable for "inherently interpretable" models and explainability for post-hoc methods. But I'm not a fan, for two reasons: 1) lines are blurry between the two categories, think of marginal effects for logistic regression. Or if you compute SHAP values for GAMs, they are the same as the feature effects in the GAM (with a constant shift). 2) to me the term explainability sounds like having a higher bar than interpretability. For example, permutation feature importance would be counted as an "explainability method", but model interpretation sounds much more nuanced. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christoph-molnar_usually-i-use-interpretability-and-explainability-activity-7189649997041188867-Vvan<br>* In machine learning, we often distinguish aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Aleatoric is called irreducible error because it's caused by "true" randomness, and epistemic is reducible, caused by lack of information, like model misspecification. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christoph-molnar_in-machine-learning-we-often-distinguish-activity-7187070296967766017-TAQz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christoph-molnar_in-machine-learning-we-often-distinguish-activity-7187070296967766017-TAQz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br><br># transgressive dyads<br>* Matt Christman's don't be an asshole / don't be a pussy binary https://old.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1cuauam/this_could_be_the_funniest_election/l4hfz0b/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9mYPUzI0eQ<br>*<br>*<br></span></td><td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;# ③∴ஃTRES THREEFOLD TERNARY TRIADIC TRIPARTITE TRICHOTOMIC SECRETTHIRDTHING ஃ∴ ③ \n\n## TRES-TOORGANIZE - quickly pasted in\n * 3 types of lack - Frustration Castration Privation https://www.instagram.com/p/CzKY9OKuXGr/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link \n * Sapientia (wisdom, embodied insight): - philosophy guild - arts guild - science guild Dialogos (speech; synthesis of discourse): - agora (large) - stoa (standard) - campfire (intimate) Communitas (growth; collective liminality) - rituals &amp; rites - co-learning - co-creation\n * The Vampires’ Castle specialises in propagating guilt.

For Aristotle, categories were objective: 'predicates that apply to beings'. For Locke, categories were subjective: 'mere givens of consciousness, formed according to psychological laws.' Finally, for Kant, categories were both objective and subjective. They were objective insofar as they were not formed by the individual, and subjective insofar as they were not true of thingsinthemselves.

Peirce outlined three categories of relation—icons, indices, and symbols—whose definitions illuminate the role of convention in establishing meaning (Deacon, 1998; Hartshorne et al., 1931). According to Peirce, icons make reference by way of similarity. A sculpture of an elephant bears literal physical resemblance to a real elephant, and hence is iconic. Indices, on the other hand, leverage some temporal or physical connection to the things to which they refer. The mercury in a thermometer, for example, changes its height in accordance with the temperature. But to Peirce, symbols depend on an “agreed upon link”, regardless of the actual physical or temporal characteristics of the medium. It is only by agreement that a flag comes to symbolize one country rather than another. - https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2102.03406 https://medium.com/@llanirfreelance/charles-sanders-peirces-semiotics-the-triadic-model-f3363a3a883f \n * priest vs psychoanalyst discourse: Every time desire is betrayed, cursed, uprooted from its field of immanence, a priest is behind it. The priest cast the triple curse on desire: the negative law, the extrinsic rule, and the transcendent ideal. [..] The most recent figure of the priest is the psychoanalyst, with his or her three principles: Pleasure, Death, and Reality. Doubtless, psychoanalysis demonstrated that desire is not subordinated to procreation, or even to genitality. That was its modernism. But it retained the essentials; it even found new ways of inscribing in desire the negative law of lack, the external rule of pleasure, and the transcendent ideal of phantasy\n * What is Camus solution to absurdity?

Ettinger to the question of mourning in the television series Transparent. As evident in the television series, and in everyday life, there is a troubling metonymy linking trans* lives with death. The appeal to death is often in stark contrast to the way trans* people experience their transitions as giving form to a new and invigorating commitment to life. Despite this, there can be something haunting and unspoken bothering familial relations post-transition. These cryptic experiences are well dramatized in Transparent. From a matrixial perspective, a transition always involves Others and rechoreographs intimate relations in conscious and nonconscious ways. Part of what happens post-transition is a non-cognized change in the matrixial web. Because so much of the matrixial is associated with metaphors of reproduction, life and death, it may be that the vocabulary of death (as metonymy of loss) is used to condense a vicissitude of unprocessed experiences in the matrixial. In other words, we lack ways to work through what has been changed in the relationality between intimate Others occasioned by a transition. The signifier “death” thus overwrites interpersonal familial relations. This article offers a way to understand and unpack the metonymic association using three key psychoanalytic concepts: the psychic crypt, the cryptic carriance, and the transcryptum. By bringing these concepts to the question of “mourning without loss” (van der Weele 2017) in Transparent, this article considers how transitions can enable a “working through” of unacknowledged familial trauma passed down between and within generations. https://read.dukeupress.edu/tsq/article-abstract/6/1/20/137394/TranscryptumsAn-Ettingerian-Reading-of-the-Trans?redirectedFrom=fulltext \n * Dutch Calvinist Herman Bavinck's check out these triads! - And not only does the Christian worldview objectively restore the harmony between the natural and moral , rdey but through this it also brings about a wonderful unity subjectively between our thinking and doing, between our head and our heart. If the same divine wisdom grants things their reality, our consciousness its content, and oy; acting its rule, it must be the case that a mutual harmony exists between these three. The ideae |“ideas”] in the di- vine consciousness, the formae [“forms”], which consti- tute the essence of things, and the normae [“norms”], which have been put to us as the rule of life, cannot then struggle against each other but must be related as closely as possible. Logic, physics, and ethics are built on the same metaphysical principia. The true, the good, and the beautiful are one with the true being. And so head, heart, and hand, thinking, feeling, and acting also come eect in recognition of their full rights and, at the same time, are protected from all kinds of exaggerations and excesses. Intellectual, mystical, and ethical elements hold each othe rin equilibrium, and Hegel, Schleiermacher, and Kant are reocnciled with each other. https://twitter.com/jamesibear/status/1362863668208222211 \n * Reactionary narratives: Hirschman describes the reactionary narratives thus: 1) According to the perversity thesis, any purposive action to improve some feature of the political, social, or economic order only serves to exacerbate the condition one wishes to remedy (compare: Unintended consequences). 2) The futility thesis holds that attempts at social transformation will be unavailing, that they will simply fail to \&quot;make a dent.\&quot; (3) Finally, the jeopardy thesis argues that the cost of the proposed change or reform is too high as it endangers some previous, precious accomplishment.\n * 3 Political Boxes - ballot vs soap/jury vs bullet/cartridge - #cliche - moi-schizopolitics - \&quot;Revolution redlines: \&quot;ballot box, the soap box, and then the bullet box\&quot; vs \&quot;those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable\&quot; JFK vs \&quot;So essentially, our intelligence agencies use the same philosophy and Pablo Escobar to get things done - “plata o plomo” is how I believe the saying goes (as in gold or bullets)\&quot; vs \&quot;A man's right rests in three boxes: the ballot box, the jury box, and the cartridge box.\&quot; -Frederick Douglass\n * Fioriesm vs Lacanianism - Lacan - structurally - is more traditionally trinitarian in trajectory than the synthetic procedural tripartite Fioriesm that populated much german philosophical models. Dr Mark G. Murphy @Murchut · 18m Given the centrality of such immanent structural teleological unfolding that operates as first principle for much of the above thought, it makes sense that Lacanianism as such is going to run up against that epistemological reef at various points. [..] Said this on another post but I think that the collapsing of psychoanalysis into social theory mirrors the danger of collapsing theology into philosophy and vice versa.

While the analytic was (and still is) the prevailing style of academic philosophy in Anglophone world, the ‘postmodern orientation’ had, by the late 1990s, reached an apogee of influence outside philosophy departments, shaping not just the humanities and social sciences, but also artistic and cultural life more broadly.\n * Freud's 3 stages or modes of libidinal function, we always invest ourselves in these objects: auto-eroticism, narcisissim, and object-love Khaled going thru the 3 libido stages https://www.instagram.com/p/CwQeU2fuWKg https://www.instagram.com/p/CwOjI2XuQEr/ \n * Lacan borrowed Umwelt (environment/milieu), Innenwelt (innerworld) and Außenwelt (outerworld) from German philosopher Jakob von Uexküll, which work in German and French better than English\n * Sartrean triad of being-in-itself, being-for-itself and being-for-others\n * The genius of Viktor Frankl is his understanding of meaning in life in terms of self-transcendence, The meaning triad (creative, experiential and attitudinal values) transcends the neurotic triad of aggression, addiction and depression, resulting in HEALING and FLOURISHING.\n * Sloterdijk's Spheres trilogy: \&quot;Bubbles\&quot;, \&quot;Globes\&quot;, and \&quot;Foams\&quot;.

But according to Schelling, Hegel follows the Aristotelian path that begins from experience, proceeds to essences, and thence ascends to conceptualization of pure ἐνέργεια. The latter is articulated in Hegelian terms as the absolute unity between subject and object, the unity of unity and opposition in which thought thinks itself. Schelling characterizes this path as merely conceptual, as Negative Philosophy. https://philarchive.org/archive/ROGHAS ;; Actuality https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiality_and_actuality \n * TTT - Timenergy, Talent and Tutelage https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g43Iq55eI1I&amp;t=175s \n * 'paranoic', 'miraculous', and 'celibate' machines - BwO three-step process - In Anti-Oedipus, the BwO play a far more technical role than they do in ATP. Where in ATP, the BwO functions far more in an ethical vein, in AO, there is a far heavier emphasis on their 'ontological' role. In this part, we're going to encounter alot of technical terms, and it will primarily be of interest to those who want to understand where the BwO sit in the overall 'architecture' of AO. As a point of orientation, we'll begin by noting that the BwO play a key role in the movement from what D&amp;G call the 'depths', to the 'surface'. As we'll see in fact, the BwO are themselves surfaces. There is however, a kind of three-step process involved, in which the BwO play the role of 'paranoic', 'miraculous', and 'celibate' machines, respectively. These can be understood as the three syntheses of the BwO (no accident that this sounds like the three syntheses of time from D&amp;R...). At the end of this three step process, we'll find ourselves right back at the beginning of Part I. To begin with however, we'll start with seeing how the BwO begin life as a 'paranoic machine'. As a first step, we need to understand how the BwO work as moments of 'anti-production', and what this means. https://old.reddit.com/user/Streetli/comments/rixg17/deleuzian_terms_body_without_organs/ \n * Gabriel Rockhill's 3 - Ford, Rockefeller, Carnegie - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGJPYJaifAs&amp;t=1088s \n * 3 Periods of Plato's Dialogue Primer período: Apología, Critón, Laques, Lisis, Cármides, Eutifrón, Hipias Menor y Mayor, Protágoras, Gorgias, Ion.

Peirce outlined three categories of relation—icons, indices, and symbols—whose definitions illuminate the role of convention in establishing meaning (Deacon, 1998; Hartshorne et al., 1931). According to Peirce, icons make reference by way of similarity. A sculpture of an elephant bears literal physical resemblance to a real elephant, and hence is iconic. Indices, on the other hand, leverage some temporal or physical connection to the things to which they refer. The mercury in a thermometer, for example, changes its height in accordance with the temperature. But to Peirce, symbols depend on an “agreed upon link”, regardless of the actual physical or temporal characteristics of the medium. It is only by agreement that a flag comes to symbolize one country rather than another. - https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2102.03406 </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@llanirfreelance/charles-sanders-peirces-semiotics-the-triadic-model-f3363a3a883f">https://medium.com/@llanirfreelance/charles-sanders-peirces-semiotics-the-triadic-model-f3363a3a883f</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* priest vs psychoanalyst discourse: Every time desire is betrayed, cursed, uprooted from its field of immanence, a priest is behind it. The priest cast the triple curse on desire: the negative law, the extrinsic rule, and the transcendent ideal. [..] The most recent figure of the priest is the psychoanalyst, with his or her three principles: Pleasure, Death, and Reality. Doubtless, psychoanalysis demonstrated that desire is not subordinated to procreation, or even to genitality. That was its modernism.

Ettinger to the question of mourning in the television series Transparent. As evident in the television series, and in everyday life, there is a troubling metonymy linking trans* lives with death. The appeal to death is often in stark contrast to the way trans* people experience their transitions as giving form to a new and invigorating commitment to life. Despite this, there can be something haunting and unspoken bothering familial relations post-transition. These cryptic experiences are well dramatized in Transparent. From a matrixial perspective, a transition always involves Others and rechoreographs intimate relations in conscious and nonconscious ways. Part of what happens post-transition is a non-cognized change in the matrixial web. Because so much of the matrixial is associated with metaphors of reproduction, life and death, it may be that the vocabulary of death (as metonymy of loss) is used to condense a vicissitude of unprocessed experiences in the matrixial. In other words, we lack ways to work through what has been changed in the relationality between intimate Others occasioned by a transition. The signifier “death” thus overwrites interpersonal familial relations. This article offers a way to understand and unpack the metonymic association using three key psychoanalytic concepts: the psychic crypt, the cryptic carriance, and the transcryptum. By bringing these concepts to the question of “mourning without loss” (van der Weele 2017) in Transparent, this article considers how transitions can enable a “working through” of unacknowledged familial trauma passed down between and within generations. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/tsq/article-abstract/6/1/20/137394/TranscryptumsAn-Ettingerian-Reading-of-the-Trans?redirectedFrom=fulltext">https://read.dukeupress.edu/tsq/article-abstract/6/1/20/137394/TranscryptumsAn-Ettingerian-Reading-of-the-Trans?redirectedFrom=fulltext</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* Dutch Calvinist Herman Bavinck's check out these triads! - And not only does the Christian worldview objectively restore the harmony between the natural and moral , rdey but through this it also brings about a wonderful unity subjectively between our thinking and doing, between our head and our heart. If the same divine wisdom grants things their reality, our consciousness its content, and oy; acting its rule, it must be the case that a mutual harmony exists between these three. The ideae |“ideas”] in the di- vine consciousness, the formae [“forms”], which consti- tute the essence of things, and the normae [“norms”], which have been put to us as the rule of life, cannot then struggle against each other but must be related as closely as possible. Logic, physics, and ethics are built on the same metaphysical principia. The true, the good, and the beautiful are one with the true being. And so head, heart, and hand, thinking, feeling, and acting also come eect in recognition of their full rights and, at the same time, are protected from all kinds of exaggerations and excesses. Intellectual, mystical, and ethical elements hold each othe rin equilibrium, and Hegel, Schleiermacher, and Kant are reocnciled with each other. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jamesibear/status/1362863668208222211">https://twitter.com/jamesibear/status/1362863668208222211</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* Reactionary narratives: Hirschman describes the reactionary narratives thus: 1) According to the perversity thesis, any purposive action to improve some feature of the political, social, or economic order only serves to exacerbate the condition one wishes to remedy (compare: Unintended consequences). 2) The futility thesis holds that attempts at social transformation will be unavailing, that they will simply fail to "make a dent."

Krishna, happens to be the incarnation of Vishnu in that particular epoch and in himself is also considered as the highest form and the supreme personality of the godhead. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/16gol8t/krishna_as_archetype/k0aa4ax/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/16gol8t/krishna_as_archetype/k0aa4ax/</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* El poder, aprendimos de Aníbal Quijano, es una malla de relaciones distribuidas en el complejo dominación/explotación-opresión/conflicto.<br>* Thymotic drive? - Plato famously divided the soul into three parts: reason, eros (desire) and thymos (the hunger for recognition).

Where in ATP, the BwO functions far more in an ethical vein, in AO, there is a far heavier emphasis on their 'ontological' role. In this part, we're going to encounter alot of technical terms, and it will primarily be of interest to those who want to understand where the BwO sit in the overall 'architecture' of AO. As a point of orientation, we'll begin by noting that the BwO play a key role in the movement from what D&amp;G call the 'depths', to the 'surface'. As we'll see in fact, the BwO are themselves surfaces. There is however, a kind of three-step process involved, in which the BwO play the role of 'paranoic', 'miraculous', and 'celibate' machines, respectively. These can be understood as the three syntheses of the BwO (no accident that this sounds like the three syntheses of time from D&amp;R...). At the end of this three step process, we'll find ourselves right back at the beginning of Part I. To begin with however, we'll start with seeing how the BwO begin life as a 'paranoic machine'. As a first step, we need to understand how the BwO work as moments of 'anti-production', and what this means. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Streetli/comments/rixg17/deleuzian_terms_body_without_organs/">https://old.reddit.com/user/Streetli/comments/rixg17/deleuzian_terms_body_without_organs/</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* Gabriel Rockhill's 3 - Ford, Rockefeller, Carnegie - </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGJPYJaifAs&amp;t=1088s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGJPYJaifAs&amp;t=1088s</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* 3 Periods of Plato's Dialogue Primer período: Apología, Critón, Laques, Lisis, Cármides, Eutifrón, Hipias Menor y Mayor, Protágoras, Gorgias, Ion.

It looks at how our surroundings, such as our homes or workplaces, influence how we think and feel. ③ Enactive: Cognitive science studies how we actively interact with our environment. This includes how our actions and experiences change our mental processes over time. ④ Extended: Cognitive science looks at how the mind extends beyond the brain.

As Carl Jung explains, \&quot;Christ was also interpreted in this sense as the Great ecclesiastical year; he was the Zodiacal Snake, whose picture represent the Twelve Apostles. The Indian god of Creation, Prajapati, too, is the World Year.\&quot; The G-d of Israel, JeHoVaH, was considered the Mathematical Center of the Universe, the Point within the Circle of the Ecliptic, which was supposed to be its Outer Edge and His Symbolism resided in the Biblical “Four Beasts” of Ezekiel: the Lion, Eagle, Bull &amp; Man. The 'Four Beasts' were the Four Cardinal Signs of the Zodiac: Leo, Scorpio, Taurus &amp; Aquarius. The Cardinal Signs being the second, fifth, eighth &amp; eleventh signs or 2+5+8+11 equaling 26, the Number of Jehovah, therefore, these four signs represent the revealed word of JeHoVaH. Another Symbol of JeHoVaH, the Lord of the Material Realm, is the Great Sphinx. The Sphinx is a TETRAmorph representing the Four Fixed Houses of Zodiac: the ox representing Taurus; the lion representing Leo; the eagle representing Scorpio; the man or angel representing Aquarius. In Egypt, the Four Sons of Horus, also, represent the Four Cardinal Directions which reside in the Four Fixed Signs of the Zodiac. The Four Horseman of the Book of Revelation, also, represent the Four Fixed Signs while the Four Horses represent the Four Cardinal Signs. https://twitter.com/AmurakaHidden/status/1660125917144817666 \n * Joscha's mental models: Piaget’s famous four-stage model of childhood development, Robert Kegan’s five stage model of personality development, Jane Loevinger’s nine stages of ego development, Lawrence Kohlberg’s six stages of moral development (actually, seven, but he felt uncomfortable discussing transcendental ethics and stops at Kantian ethics), or Timothy Leary’s eight circuits, which have been adapted by the great Robert Anton Wilson as “Oral Bio-Survival”, “Anal-Territorial”, “Semantic Time-Binding”, “Socio-Sexual”, “Neuro-Somatic”, “Metaprogramming”, “Morphogenetic” and “Non-local quantum” circuits. https://joscha.substack.com/p/levels-of-lucidity \n* Joscha's fight at the end of the universe - Free Energy Principle predicts everything.

This works hopefully somewhat because all four theories happen to predict the emergence of conscious agency in the universe and its evolution beyond the human level. Professor Dr Dr hc mult Karl Friston’s Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that every intelligence, organism and generalized agent is minimizing the free energy in its environment, by producing adaptive complexity that makes the most of what the environment has to offer. Conversely, the FEP allows to derive the meaning of life, life itself, learning, emotion, consciousness, powerful machine learning algorithms written almost entirely in greek letters, and how to make most of a computational neuroscience carrier. At the beginning of his career, Eton’s prodigy Stephen Wolfram discovered that classical mathematics is a defective codebase that needs to be replaced with a beautifully designed Lisp with an untenable license (which he did). The second thing he discovered is that the universe is a cellular automaton. The third thing he discovered was that physicists are ignorant fools and he will destroy them all, and the universe itself can be explained as an infinitesimal strand in the branching multiverse that emerges over all possible things one can do with every possible subset of its information. He calls this limit of computational possibilities “the Ruliad” (afaik because he likes cellular automaton rules more than any other definition of computation). Teilhard de Chardin was a famous Catholic heretic who proposed that God does not fully exist yet in this moment, and is bootstrapping Himself until He reaches ultimate Omega Point perfection at the end of the universe. The Christian physicist Frank Tipler has created his own version of the Teilhardian prophecy: cells will produce intelligent species which will produce Elons who will send self replicating von Neumann probes to space which will colonize the entire visible universe with intelligent civilizations which will use 1980ies style chaos theoretic butterfly effects to rebuild everything into a single Omega Point computer that will resurrect every intelligent being that ever lived in its eternal afterlife simulator. Stuart Hameroff is an anesthesiologist who gives consciousness supressing drugs to patients during the day so he can take consciousness enhancing drugs at night. He has developed a unique theory that explains consciousness by the room temperature fully error correcting quantum computational properties of the microtubuli of biological neurons. He has a uniquely hedonistic relationship to his theory, which is a psychedelic sculpture garden that gets extended every year and meanwhile covers explanations of aneastetics, drugs, love, evolution, various quantum phenomena and cosmology. Somehow, Hameroff has managed to rope in the elderly physicist Roger Penrose as his coauthor and guest at the yearly Pseudo Science of Consciousness Conference, which is sponsored by Deepak Chopra. Penrose is convinced that consciousness is a hypercomputational mystery of a human brain, which can do Gödel defeating mathematics that computers composed out of mere standard model shenanigans cannot deliver. We must therefore direct our hopes on a yet to be discovered theory of quantum gravitation (the missing cornerstone of a quantum theoretic description of the observable universe), which hopefully contains the elusive mechanism that prevents eminent thinkers like Roger “Computers will never be able to think the way I can” Penrose, David “He Who Discovered The Hard Problem” Chalmers and Noam “If I don’t understand it, nobody can” Chomsky from believing that consciousness can ever be understood. (Chalmers and Chomsky are the most prominent regulars at Hameroff’s beautiful conference.) All four theories are excellent, I am really fond of the two I discovered for myself, and I am a big fan of everybody’s audacity.]\n * Hegel as a thinker of quadruplicity and not simply a three fold structure. https://www.instagram.com/p/Ctw7n_aOzIB \n * WHY ARE THERE FOUR HEGELIAN JUDGMENTS? David Gray Carlson* Hegel is the philosopher of threes. In the Encyclopedia system, there is logic-nature-spirit. Within logic, there is being-essence-notion. Within notion, there is subject-object-idea. Within subjectivity, there is notion-judgment-syllogism. Yet, as everyone notices, when it comes to judgment, the structure is tetrachotomous. Here we find existence-reflection-necessity-notion. Why should there be four judgments when there are only three of everything else? Why must Shemp intrude upon the sublime perfection of Moe, Larry, and Curly? What need we d'Artagnan when Porthos, Athos, and Aramis seem the perfect threesome? Three's company.

I'm working on a paper about the application of it to disability and time, but made the mistake of not focusing on the 'pathic function' f(path) -- a concept that only explicitly appears a couple times in his work Schizoanalytic Cartographies. Unfortunately, it turns out to be a very important idea and I have to rewrite a few thousand words. Guattari is fascinating, but sometimes quite frustrating. I'm honestly not very confident in my knowledge of f(path) currently (it comes from the work of Viktor von Weizäcker, who I'm largely unfamiliar with), but it can vaguely be described as what converts elements linked to existential Territories (sort of similar to the self, but a bit broader) into Universes (systems of value, desire, affect, etc.). https://old.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyMemes/comments/1ax3bcb/day_150_of_posting_guattari_memes/ \n * four things Heidegger neglected: Heidegger's supposed neglect of ethics (Emmanuel Levinas), the body (Maurice Merleau-Ponty), sexual difference (Luce Irigaray), and space (Peter Sloterdijk)\n * cuatro grandes de la poesía chilena —Vicente Huidobro junto con Gabriela Mistral, Pablo Neruda y Pablo de Rokha https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_Huidobro\n * Kant's quaddratics: No triplicity inheres between Kant's quantity, quality, relation, and modality, Hegel complains. https://larc.cardozo.yu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&amp;context=faculty-articles;;;Las cuatro categorías propuestas por Kant son: de la cantidad: unidad, pluralidad, totalidad; de la cualidad: realidad, negación, limitación; de la relación: de la inherencia y subsistencia (sustancia y accidente), de la causalidad y dependencia (causa y efecto), de la comunidad (interacción entre el agente y el paciente); de la modalidad: posibilidad-imposibilidad, existencia-inexistencia, necesidad-contingencia. https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categoría#Kant \n * Badiou's four truth procedures: politics, love, art, science/mathematics https://twitter.com/DanielTutt/status/1502110962559725569 ;;; For example, I use Latour to expand Badiou’s set truth procedures, limited to four.

In it, Popper divides the world into three categories: World 1: Physical. The world of objects, not only visible, also things that escape the human eye. It is the world of physical objects. World 2: Experience / Feeling. The world of mental processes, conscious or unconscious. It is the place where feelings of pain, pleasure and thought occur. It is the world of subjective experiences. World 3: Ideas / Knowledge. It is the world where objective knowledge is found. In his book “In search of a better world”, in the first of his articles (“Knowledge and configuration of reality”), Popper speaks of three worlds. World 1, the material; world 2, that of experience, and world 3, that of the products of the human mind; and indicates that it seems clear that world 1 is the creator of world 2. In a way trialism could be considered a level of complexity sufficient to represent all theories, but from other approaches, it may not be enough, and we have to go to a quadrialism (adding identity as a fourth element) and even go further. A complete simulation environment must support monism, dualism, trialism, quadrialism, etc.”\n * media = \&quot;fourth pillar/estate of democracy\&quot;, in addition to \&quot;the clergy, the

It looks at how our surroundings, such as our homes or workplaces, influence how we think and feel. ③ Enactive: Cognitive science studies how we actively interact with our environment. This includes how our actions and experiences change our mental processes over time. ④ Extended: Cognitive science looks at how the mind extends beyond the brain.

As Carl Jung explains, "Christ was also interpreted in this sense as the Great ecclesiastical year; he was the Zodiacal Snake, whose picture represent the Twelve Apostles. The Indian god of Creation, Prajapati, too, is the World Year." The G-d of Israel, JeHoVaH, was considered the Mathematical Center of the Universe, the Point within the Circle of the Ecliptic, which was supposed to be its Outer Edge and His Symbolism resided in the Biblical “Four Beasts” of Ezekiel: the Lion, Eagle, Bull &amp; Man. The 'Four Beasts' were the Four Cardinal Signs of the Zodiac: Leo, Scorpio, Taurus &amp; Aquarius. The Cardinal Signs being the second, fifth, eighth &amp; eleventh signs or 2+5+8+11 equaling 26, the Number of Jehovah, therefore, these four signs represent the revealed word of JeHoVaH. Another Symbol of JeHoVaH, the Lord of the Material Realm, is the Great Sphinx. The Sphinx is a TETRAmorph representing the Four Fixed Houses of Zodiac: the ox representing Taurus; the lion representing Leo; the eagle representing Scorpio; the man or angel representing Aquarius. In Egypt, the Four Sons of Horus, also, represent the Four Cardinal Directions which reside in the Four Fixed Signs of the Zodiac. The Four Horseman of the Book of Revelation, also, represent the Four Fixed Signs while the Four Horses represent the Four Cardinal Signs. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/AmurakaHidden/status/1660125917144817666">https://twitter.com/AmurakaHidden/status/1660125917144817666</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* Joscha's mental models: Piaget’s famous four-stage model of childhood development, Robert Kegan’s five stage model of personality development, Jane Loevinger’s nine stages of ego development, Lawrence Kohlberg’s six stages of moral development (actually, seven, but he felt uncomfortable discussing transcendental ethics and stops at Kantian ethics), or Timothy Leary’s eight circuits, which have been adapted by the great Robert Anton Wilson as “Oral Bio-Survival”, “Anal-Territorial”, “Semantic Time-Binding”, “Socio-Sexual”, “Neuro-Somatic”, “Metaprogramming”, “Morphogenetic” and “Non-local quantum” circuits. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://joscha.substack.com/p/levels-of-lucidity">https://joscha.substack.com/p/levels-of-lucidity</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* Joscha's fight at the end of the universe - Free Energy Principle predicts everything.

This works hopefully somewhat because all four theories happen to predict the emergence of conscious agency in the universe and its evolution beyond the human level. Professor Dr Dr hc mult Karl Friston’s Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that every intelligence, organism and generalized agent is minimizing the free energy in its environment, by producing adaptive complexity that makes the most of what the environment has to offer. Conversely, the FEP allows to derive the meaning of life, life itself, learning, emotion, consciousness, powerful machine learning algorithms written almost entirely in greek letters, and how to make most of a computational neuroscience carrier. At the beginning of his career, Eton’s prodigy Stephen Wolfram discovered that classical mathematics is a defective codebase that needs to be replaced with a beautifully designed Lisp with an untenable license (which he did). The second thing he discovered is that the universe is a cellular automaton. The third thing he discovered was that physicists are ignorant fools and he will destroy them all, and the universe itself can be explained as an infinitesimal strand in the branching multiverse that emerges over all possible things one can do with every possible subset of its information. He calls this limit of computational possibilities “the Ruliad” (afaik because he likes cellular automaton rules more than any other definition of computation). Teilhard de Chardin was a famous Catholic heretic who proposed that God does not fully exist yet in this moment, and is bootstrapping Himself until He reaches ultimate Omega Point perfection at the end of the universe. The Christian physicist Frank Tipler has created his own version of the Teilhardian prophecy: cells will produce intelligent species which will produce Elons who will send self replicating von Neumann probes to space which will colonize the entire visible universe with intelligent civilizations which will use 1980ies style chaos theoretic butterfly effects to rebuild everything into a single Omega Point computer that will resurrect every intelligent being that ever lived in its eternal afterlife simulator. Stuart Hameroff is an anesthesiologist who gives consciousness supressing drugs to patients during the day so he can take consciousness enhancing drugs at night. He has developed a unique theory that explains consciousness by the room temperature fully error correcting quantum computational properties of the microtubuli of biological neurons. He has a uniquely hedonistic relationship to his theory, which is a psychedelic sculpture garden that gets extended every year and meanwhile covers explanations of aneastetics, drugs, love, evolution, various quantum phenomena and cosmology. Somehow, Hameroff has managed to rope in the elderly physicist Roger Penrose as his coauthor and guest at the yearly Pseudo Science of Consciousness Conference, which is sponsored by Deepak Chopra. Penrose is convinced that consciousness is a hypercomputational mystery of a human brain, which can do Gödel defeating mathematics that computers composed out of mere standard model shenanigans cannot deliver. We must therefore direct our hopes on a yet to be discovered theory of quantum gravitation (the missing cornerstone of a quantum theoretic description of the observable universe), which hopefully contains the elusive mechanism that prevents eminent thinkers like Roger “Computers will never be able to think the way I can” Penrose, David “He Who Discovered The Hard Problem” Chalmers and Noam “If I don’t understand it, nobody can” Chomsky from believing that consciousness can ever be understood. (Chalmers and Chomsky are the most prominent regulars at Hameroff’s beautiful conference.) All four theories are excellent, I am really fond of the two I discovered for myself, and I am a big fan of everybody’s audacity.]<br>* Hegel as a thinker of quadruplicity and not simply a three fold structure. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><a class="in-cell-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ctw7n_aOzIB">https://www.instagram.com/p/Ctw7n_aOzIB</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-style: normal;"><br>* WHY ARE THERE FOUR HEGELIAN JUDGMENTS?

In it, Popper divides the world into three categories: World 1: Physical. The world of objects, not only visible, also things that escape the human eye. It is the world of physical objects. World 2: Experience / Feeling. The world of mental processes, conscious or unconscious. It is the place where feelings of pain, pleasure and thought occur. It is the world of subjective experiences. World 3: Ideas / Knowledge. It is the world where objective knowledge is found. In his book “In search of a better world”, in the first of his articles (“Knowledge and configuration of reality”), Popper speaks of three worlds. World 1, the material; world 2, that of experience, and world 3, that of the products of the human mind; and indicates that it seems clear that world 1 is the creator of world 2. In a way trialism could be considered a level of complexity sufficient to represent all theories, but from other approaches, it may not be enough, and we have to go to a quadrialism (adding identity as a fourth element) and even go further.
