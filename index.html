<div>Russell's paradox shows that every set theory that contains an unrestricted comprehension principle leads to contradictions. The paradox had already been discovered independently in 1899 by the German mathematician Ernst Zermelo. However, Zermelo did not publish the idea, which remained known only to David Hilbert, Edmund Husserl, and other academics at the University of Göttingen. At the end of the 1890s, Georg Cantor – considered the founder of modern set theory – had already realized that his theory would lead to a contradiction, as he told Hilbert and Richard Dedekind by letter. Because restricting comprehension avoided Russell's paradox, several mathematicians including Zermelo, Fraenkel, and Gödel considered it the most important axiom of set theory </div>

<div>A category is some collection of objects and morphisms. Whatever that collection is, it can’t be a set (at least not in the ZFC sense) because of Russell’s paradox, or else it would not be possible to talk about a category whose objects are sets. At a foundational level, that collection is usually defined as a class, which is kind of like one step up from a set: a class contains sets, but a class never contains another class (so you don’t have to worry about the class of all classes). In an alternate terminology, all sets are said to be classes, and a class which is not a set is called a proper class. A category whose collections of objects and morphisms are both sets is called a small category, and if at least one of them is a proper class, it is called a large category. An intermediate level, which comes up quite frequently, is a locally small category. A locally small category is a category where, for every two objects X and Y , the class of morphisms from X to Y is a set. The category S e t , whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are functions, is an important instance of a large category (because its class of objects is not a set, precisely because Russell’s paradox dictates that there is no set of all sets), but which is locally small (for any pre-chosen sets X and Y , you can construct the set of functions from X to Y ; it’s the subset of P ( X × Y ) ). One interesting category is the category of small categories, written C a t , whose objects are small categories and whose morphisms are functors between them. Russell’s paradox is not an issue here, because C a t itself is a large category, so is not one of its own objects. Occasionally referred to is C A T , the category of large categories, but discussing C A T requires a foundation accounting for collections of classes, in which case C A T is not a large category, but a “very-large” category. As such, none of these categories contain themselves as objects. https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-category-in-math-and-why-does-the-category-of-sets-not-violate-Russells-paradox</div>


<form action="#" class="usertext warn-on-unload" onsubmit="return post_form(this, 'editusertext')" id="form-t1_e3tlnvyvpy"><input type="hidden" name="thing_id" value="t1_e3tlnvy"><div class="usertext-body may-blank-within md-container "><div class="md"><p>For a lot of the 19th and early 20th centuries, mathematicians were working with all sorts of different abstract mathematical structures. People interested in highly abstract geometric spaces might work with "topological spaces"; those interested in symmetries of objects might work with "groups"; those interested in arithmetic-like structures where you can add, subtract, and multiply objects (whether those objects are integers, matrices, or whatever) might work with "rings"; those interested in how structures are ordered (like the integers by the &lt; relation, or sets by the "subset of" relation) might work with "preorders". In each case, it was found that one of the best ways of understanding these structures was to study certain functions between them: you can learn a lot about topological spaces by looking at the <em>continuous</em> functions between those spaces. So we end up with a sort of list of structures like this:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Structure</th> <th>abstracts...</th> <th>deals with...</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td>Set</td> <td>arbitrary collections of objects</td> <td>functions</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Topological space</td> <td>geometric spaces</td> <td>continuous functions</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Group</td> <td>symmetry</td> <td>group homomorphisms</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Ring</td> <td>arithmetic</td> <td>ring homomorphisms</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Preorder</td> <td>ordering</td> <td>order-preserving functions</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Vector space</td> <td>vectors</td> <td>linear transformations</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Category theory started with the observation that this "study of functions" is not just coincidence. It looks at what each of these "categories" of object (set, group, ring, etc.) has in common, and what this says about each of those structures. You might not think there would be much in common between a geometric space, an arbitrary set of objects, and a collection of vectors, but category theory lets us see the underlying abstractions and make connections between them. It's a very powerful way of looking at all the branches of mathematics at once and getting results about many or all of them.</p> <p>Another interesting point about category theory is that it can serve as a foundation of mathematics. Basically, any mathematical statement in any field of mathematics developed so far can be rewritten as a (possibly very technical and complicated) statement of category theory. It's not the only possible foundation - and actually, set theory is still considered the "default" foundation - but this shows how powerful and expressive category theory can be.</p> </div> </div></form>
