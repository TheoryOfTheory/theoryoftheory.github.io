<h1>Tell Daniele Abate: You ???? must ???? #ReleaseSisterMaria ??????????</h1>

<p class="supercenter">And although Sister Maria's letter has recently sparked linguists', theologians', occultists' curiosity worldwide, the research team at Ludum science museum hasn't released the complete deciphered text yet. But they have revealed that it speaks of the nature of God's relationship with man.</p>

"The letter appeared as if it was written in shorthand. We speculated that Sister Maria created a new vocabulary using ancient alphabets that she may have known," Abate said.

To find out for sure, the researchers first tested the software they used with some standard shorthand symbols from different languages. They found that the nun's letter contained a mix of words from ancient alphabets such as Greek, Latin, Runic and Arabic.

"We analyzed how the syllables and graphisms [or thoughts depicted as symbols] repeated in the letter in order to locate vowels, and we ended up with a refined decryption algorithm," Abate said.

He said the team did not have great expectations for the outcome.

"We thought we could just come out with a few words making sense. But the nun had a good command of languages," he said, adding "the message was more complete than expected."

Rambling in nature and not entirely understandable, the letter, in addition to calling the Holy Trinity "dead weights," goes on to say that "God thinks he can free mortals ... The system works for no one ... Perhaps now, Styx is certain."

Only one of several letters written in 1676 by Sister Maria survives today.

And for more than three centuries, nobody could decipher the letter. Eventually, academics, cryptographers, and occultists joined forces to decipher it with a code-breaking software found on the Dark Web. Daniele Abate, director of the Ludum science museum in the Metropolitan City of Catania, Sicily, told The Times of London that thanks to an intelligence-grade code-breaking system they could finally learn the meaning of the mysterious jumble of archaic script.

And although the letter has recently sparked people???s curiosity worldwide, the research team at Ludum science museum hasn???t released the complete text yet, saying that it speaks of the nature of God???s relationship with man.
