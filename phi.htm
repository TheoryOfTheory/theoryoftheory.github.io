For Locke, categories were subjective: 'mere givens of consciousness, formed according to psychological laws.' Finally, for Kant, categories were both objective and subjective. They were objective insofar as they were not formed by the individual, and subjective insofar as they were not true of thingsinthemselves.

  * Our definition of a symbol draws on the work of the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce. Peirce outlined three categories of relation‚Äîicons, indices, and symbols‚Äîwhose definitions illuminate the role of convention in establishing meaning (Deacon, 1998; Hartshorne et al., 1931). According to Peirce, icons make reference by way of similarity. A sculpture of an elephant bears literal physical resemblance to a real elephant, and hence is iconic. Indices, on the other hand, leverage some temporal or physical connection to the things to which they refer. The mercury in a thermometer, for example, changes its height in accordance with the temperature. But to Peirce, symbols depend on an ‚Äúagreed upon link‚Äù, regardless of the actual physical or temporal characteristics of the medium. It is only by agreement that a flag comes to symbolize one country rather than another. - https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2102.03406  https://medium.com/@llanirfreelance/charles-sanders-peirces-semiotics-the-triadic-model-f3363a3a883f
  * priest vs psychoanalyst discourse: Every time desire is betrayed, cursed, uprooted from its field of immanence, a priest is behind it. The priest cast the triple curse on desire: the negative law, the extrinsic rule, and the transcendent ideal. [..] The most recent figure of the priest is the psychoanalyst, with his or her three principles: Pleasure, Death, and Reality. Doubtless, psychoanalysis demonstrated that desire is not subordinated to procreation, or even to genitality. That was its modernism. But it retained the essentials; it even found new ways of inscribing in desire the negative law of lack, the external rule of pleasure, and the transcendent ideal of phantasy
  * What is Camus solution to absurdity? Camus outlined three possible responses to the meaninglessness of life which are: suicide, revolt and the leap of faith. He condemned suicide and the existential leap as evasions and endorsed revolt as a proper solution to absurdity of life. [..] "I draw from the Absurd three consequences: my revolt, my liberty, my passion." [..] Camus argued against the ‚Äúleap of faith‚Äù of Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky considering it as ‚Äúphilosophical suicide‚Äù. His response to the absurd is to revolt, which he considers as the only coherent philosophical position.

  * Brach's three key psychoanalytic concepts: the psychic crypt, the cryptic carriance, and the transcryptum - This article brings the psychoanalysis of Bracha L. Ettinger to the question of mourning in the television series Transparent. As evident in the television series, and in everyday life, there is a troubling metonymy linking trans* lives with death. The appeal to death is often in stark contrast to the way trans* people experience their transitions as giving form to a new and invigorating commitment to life. Despite this, there can be something haunting and unspoken bothering familial relations post-transition. These cryptic experiences are well dramatized in Transparent. From a matrixial perspective, a transition always involves Others and rechoreographs intimate relations in conscious and nonconscious ways. Part of what happens post-transition is a non-cognized change in the matrixial web. Because so much of the matrixial is associated with metaphors of reproduction, life and death, it may be that the vocabulary of death (as metonymy of loss) is used to condense a vicissitude of unprocessed experiences in the matrixial. In other words, we lack ways to work through what has been changed in the relationality between intimate Others occasioned by a transition. The signifier ‚Äúdeath‚Äù thus overwrites interpersonal familial relations. This article offers a way to understand and unpack the metonymic association using three key psychoanalytic concepts: the psychic crypt, the cryptic carriance, and the transcryptum. By bringing these concepts to the question of ‚Äúmourning without loss‚Äù (van der Weele 2017) in Transparent, this article considers how transitions can enable a ‚Äúworking through‚Äù of unacknowledged familial trauma passed down between and within generations. https://read.dukeupress.edu/tsq/article-abstract/6/1/20/137394/TranscryptumsAn-Ettingerian-Reading-of-the-Trans?redirectedFrom=fulltext

Dr Mark G. Murphy @Murchut ¬∑ 18m Given the centrality of such immanent structural teleological unfolding that operates as first principle for much of the above thought, it makes sense that Lacanianism  as such is going to run up against that epistemological reef at various points. [..] Said this on another post but I think that the collapsing of psychoanalysis into social theory mirrors the danger of collapsing theology into philosophy and vice versa. Unity-in-tension as Przywara articulates is infinitely preferable to ‚Äòtheosophical‚Äô synthesis. https://twitter.com/Murchut/status/1603730991620792322 [..] Guys I can't believe Lacan killed Marxism. How could a former psychiatrist in 20th century Paris do this?
  * Reactionary narratives: Hirschman describes the reactionary narratives thus: 1) According to the perversity thesis, any purposive action to improve some feature of the political, social, or economic order only serves to exacerbate the condition one wishes to remedy (compare: Unintended consequences). 2) The futility thesis holds that attempts at social transformation will be unavailing, that they will simply fail to "make a dent." (3) Finally, the jeopardy thesis argues that the cost of the proposed change or reform is too high as it endangers some previous, precious accomplishment.

  * The Tetragrammaton from Ancient Greek œÑŒµœÑœÅŒ±Œ≥œÅŒ¨ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒøŒΩ tetragr√°mmaton '[consisting of] four letters'), or Tetragram, is the four-letter Hebrew theonym ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î‚Äé (transliterated as YHWH), the name of God in the Hebrew Bible.

This includes how physical activity, such as sports or dance, can influence cognition. 2. Embedded: Cognitive science studies how the environment and context of our brains impacts our thought processes. It looks at how our surroundings, such as our homes or workplaces, influence how we think and feel. 3. Enactive: Cognitive science studies how we actively interact with our environment. This includes how our actions and experiences change our mental processes over time. 4. Extended: Cognitive science looks at how the mind extends beyond the brain. This includes how our thoughts and experiences can be shared with other people and how technology can be used to enhance cognition.
