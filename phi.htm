However, they had different theoretical approaches and emphasized different aspects of Marxism. Laclau was a post-structuralist Marxist who was interested in the role of discourse and ideology in the construction of social reality. He argued that hegemony is not a fixed or stable state, but rather a process of articulation in which different social forces come together to form a temporary unity. Lefebvre was a Marxist humanist who was interested in the everyday life of ordinary people. He argued that everyday life is a site of struggle where people can resist the dominant ideology and create new forms of sociality. Luk√°cs was a Marxist philosopher who was interested in the nature of class consciousness. He argued that class consciousness is not something that is given, but rather something that must be won through struggle. He also argued that the proletariat is the only class that is capable of achieving true class consciousness. The work of Laclau, Lefebvre, and Luk√°cs has had a profound impact on contemporary social theory. Their work has been used to explain a wide range of social phenomena, from the rise of populism to the development of new social movements.

Lasch was a cultural critic who was interested in the nature of consumer culture and the rise of the therapeutic culture. He argued that consumer culture is a form of false consciousness that prevents people from understanding their true interests. He also argued that the therapeutic culture is a form of social control that encourages people to focus on their own personal problems and to ignore the larger social problems.
