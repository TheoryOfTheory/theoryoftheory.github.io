GamiFIN takeaways
one-grouppre-test-post-test-design
* Lots of impressive designs different designs 
* I loved the spirit of "minimizing inhibition threshold" of using new things.

Just following up from this gamification conference:

* I thought it was primarily for the environment, the conference also had logistics, school safety, healthcare-related gamification studies.
* Sadly being on US East Coast, I planned poorly and missed a lot of early Finland-time workshops and only attended the general sessions the shared research.
* The variety of research ranged from surprisingly simple ("one group pre-test-post-test design"), and some more systematic.
* One used exploratory cluster analysis to identify 7 seven distinct categories among 20,000 gamified fitness platform users based on their behaviours on an exercise app.
* One had measured adaptations to a "12-dimension taxonomy" for sustabinable consumption (borrowed ) and concluded that "a more critical approach to certain gamification dimensions, such as rewards, that could undermine not only intrinsic motivation but also the very sustainability that the apps promote."
* One study around forest-goers: the experts thought that it would be prudent for location-based games (LBGs) to teach players about how to behave in forests or natural environments. For example, in Finland, irrespective of forest ownership, there are everyman’s rights that grant people the legal right to walk in forests as well as gather berries and mushrooms from there. LBGs could inform players about such rights. Furthermore, the games could teach about how to navigate in nature by providing a terrain map or teach about flora, fungi and animals that dwell in the forest.
* One really cool thing I learned is the "hexad

** I'm looking for a quote from my fellow #gamification professionals to help me make an argument for why we need a shorter Hexad questionnaire. Thoughts, Andrzej, Roman, Thomas, Amy Jo? Would love to be able to quote you in my next paper.


"Gamified apps for sustainable consumption (SC): a systematic review"
Gamification concepts for mobile apps, an
adaptation of a 12-dimension taxonomy [10] to
identify and understand how gamification is
designed and implemented in mobile apps. The
dimensions (and characteristics within) are: 1.
gamification concept-to-user communication
(direct or mediated); 2. user identity (virtual
character or self-selected), 3. rewards (internal,
internal and external, none), 4. competition
(direct, indirect, none), 5. target group, 6.
collaboration (cooperative, supportive only,
none), 7. goal setting (self-set, externally set), 8.
narrative (continuous, episodic), 9. reinforcement
(positive, positive-negative), 10. level of
integration (independent, inherent), 11.
persuasive intent (compliance, behavior, attitude),
and, 12. user advancement (presentation,
progressive, none)

The world of apps keeps morphing and
adapting to trends. This study shows the need for
a more holistic understanding of SC
